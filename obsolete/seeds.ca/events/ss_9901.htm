        is not one event, but an annual series of separate events, which have sprung up across the country.
        Seedy Saturday - or in some communities, a Seedy Sunday - is a community seed exchange. It is usually
        operated as a non-profit public event, staffed by volunteers who are committed to the betterment of the
        local gardening community. These annual seed swaps bring together home gardeners, seed savers, native
        plant collectors, agriculture conservation groups, community gardeners and local seed companies that
        sell open-pollinated varieties of vegetables, fruits, flowers, grains and herbs.</P><P>
        The event began in 1989 in Vancouver and has spread across Canada, giving people a chance to come together
        to learn more about seed saving and biodiversity conservation. Come meet local people who share your interest in seeds!</P><P>
        You can find help for your garden, swap your favourite seeds with other gardeners, and buy open-pollinated
        heritage seeds and plants which are not genetically engineered and which grow well in organic and low input conditions.</P><P>
        These events are locally organized and run. Many of them are co-sponsored by our organization, Seeds of Diversity
        Canada, a non-profit group of gardeners and farmers whose goal is keep the best plants that generations of gardeners
        have treasured.</P><P>
        Find out how you can encourage biodiversity in your own backyard! Attend the Seedy Saturday in your area.</P>
