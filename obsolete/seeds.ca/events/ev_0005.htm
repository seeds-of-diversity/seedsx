<H2>Growing Cultures Exhibit</H2><BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Toronto ON, May 2000 through January 2002</B></P>
<p>The Royal Ontario Museum's "Growing Cultures" runs from May 6, 2000 until January, 2002.
This photography exhibit explores the gardening traditions of diverse cultures in Toronto
through 41 colour and black and white photographs. According to the ROM, "Growing Cultures is
the culmination of five years of research and documentation by researcher Dr. Gerda R. Wekerle,
professor of Environmental Studies at York University, and photographer Vincenzo Pietropaolo.
The exhibit demonstrates how immigrants can enhance the life of a city by reshaping
neighbourhoods, introducing new cuisine, and expanding the potential for urban gardens."</p>
<p>The featured gardens are planned and maintained in the Greater Toronto Area by immigrant
gardeners from 18 different countries, some of whom are recent immigrants to Canada, and others
who have made Canada their home for several decades.</p>
<p>"The exhibit is equipped with audio stations that allow some of the featured gardeners to
share their gardening stories and traditions with visitors. A selection of related gardening
implements are also on display, as well as heritage seeds of diverse origins saved by gardeners
to ensure continuity of the plants and vegetables necessary to maintain their traditional
cuisine."</p>
