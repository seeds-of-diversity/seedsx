<H2>Celebrate Surrey's Garden Heritage at Historic Stewart Farm</H2><BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Surrey BC, April 15 2000</B></P>

<P>Surrey's citizens have been gardening since the first settlers arrived before
the turn of the last century, growing fruits and vegetables for their tables,
to sell at market and to feed their livestock, herbs to treat minor illnesses,
and flowers to lift weary spirits.  On Saturday, April 15 learn more about
Surrey's gardening traditions by visiting the Historic Stewart Farm where you
can shop the Heritage Plant and Seed Sale put on by the Heritage Garden
Volunteers, and take a tour of this historic site's heirloom vegetable and
flower gardens. From 1 to 3 pm, join garden writer Jeff Kingsley for an
illustrated presentation on heritage seeds. A restored 1894 farmhouse and
heritage site, the Historic Stewart Farm is located at 13723 Crescent Road,
Surrey, B.C. For more information and to pre-register for the presentation,
call 604 502-6456.
