<h2>Growing Garlic</h2>
<P>
<IMG src='logo_GCGC2.gif' align=right>
Garlic is a very easy plant to grow, even in a small garden. Here
are some useful tips for growing Great Canadian Garlic.
</P><P>
<B>Planting:</B> Garlic is best planted three to five weeks before the
ground freezes hard. In most areas of Canada plant in October
or early November. Garlic likes a rich, soft soil so prepare your
garlic bed by digging in plenty of compost. Select the best
looking bulbs to plant, avoiding any that are mouldy or damaged
since these will more likely rot than grow. Peel each bulb and
break the cloves apart gently. Garlic can bruise and spoil, like
apples, if handled too roughly. Leave the clove wrappers on and
plant each clove separately about four to six inches apart, and
about two inches deep (from tip to surface). The bottom of the
cloves is the tough flat part that was attached to the bottom of
the bulb.
</P><P>
<B>Mulching:</B> Since your garlic must endure the freezes and thaws
of winter, it may help to insulate the ground with a layer of
straw, leaves or other material. Leaves should be removed in
early spring to allow the garlic shoots to grow, but straw is a
good all-season mulch because it does not form a mat like
leaves do. Mulch during summer helps to reduce weeds and
retain moisture, both essential for the best garlic bulbs.
</P><P>
<B>Fertilizing:</B> When planting garlic in the fall, it is good to plant in
soil that has been amended with compost (as fertilizer). Top dressing with
compost or an organic fertilizer (such as fish with kelp) is helpful in spring
when the tops of the garlic are very actively growing.  But don't feed any
later than the end of May, when bulb maturation is beginning underground as
excess nitrogen at this time may delay bulbing, reduce the quality of the
harvested bulbs, and decrease the storage life of bulbs.
</P><P>
<B>Harvesting:</B> Garlic is ready to harvest when half to threequarters
of the leaves turn yellow. Depending on the weather,
this can be any time from mid-July to early August. Check a
few bulbs each week until you can feel the stem softening just
above the bulb, but the bulb wrappers remain firm. If you leave
the harvest too late, the cloves will burst the bulb wrappers and
this will reduce the storage life of the garlic. Dig up the bulbs
gently with a shovel or fork, shake off excess soil, and lay the
whole plants to dry out of the sun. At this stage, the bulbs are very tender and
should be treated gently to prevent bruising.
</P><P>
<B>Curing:</B> The best way to prepare garlic for storage is to allow
the bulb wrappers to "cure" by drying while still attached to the
whole plant. Since the bulb wrappers are the bottoms of the
leaves, they can dry out more slowly when the leaves are still
present. Lay the plants on a raised surface like a table, or hang
in bunches, with good ventilation and out of direct sunlight.
Remember that the cloves have never been exposed to direct
sun, and they can be damaged by excessive heat just after
harvest. A shed or shady side of a building is a good place to
dry garlic.
</P><P>
<B>Cleaning:</B> Bulbs usually come fairly clean during the drying
process, but you should brush off any excess soil with your
hands once it has become dry and flaky. Only wash soil off if it
will not brush away (this usually only happens if you have clay
soil). Cut the stems about an inch above the bulbs using pruning
shears or a sharp knife. Cut the dry roots off the bottoms to
produce neat, clean bulbs.
</P><P>
<B>Storing:</B> The best storage conditions for garlic are cool, dark,
well ventilated and fairly dry. Avoid storing in plastic bags
since this will collect condensation. about 10°C-12°C is ideal.

<P><B>Interesting Fact</B></P>
<P>You might expect garlic to keep well in the
fridge, or at low temperatures, but this just
encourages it to sprout. Remember that you
plant garlic cloves in October; cold
temperatures tell them it's time to grow!</P>

<P>
<B>Mailing:</B> If you send samples of garlic in the mail
(for instance through Seeds of Diversity's annual Seed Exchange),
send clean, well-cured, good quality bulbs. They must be sent in
a box or padded envelope to prevent damage. Canada Post charges
more for a square parcel than for a flat padded envelope. You
can carefully break up the bulbs so the cloves will fit in a
flatter envelope, but include a note explaining this, so the
recipient will not think that their garlic was smashed in transit!
