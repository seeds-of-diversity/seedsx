<h2>Your Role as a Garlic Grower</h2>
<P>
<IMG src='logo_GCGC2.gif' align=right>
Any member of Seeds of Diversity can volunteer to be a Garlic Grower
in this project. The number of volunteers is limited by the supply of
garlic each year, but we are doing our best to expand the project to
include as many volunteers as possible.
</P>

<DIV style='border:1px solid #333;background-color:#ddd;padding:1em;width:50%'">
Unfortunately we have no garlic available at this time. We encourage you to obtain interesting garlic varieties from commercial sources and
use the Garlic Observation Form to record their characteristics.
</DIV>



<P>
1) You will receive your first garlic samples in September or October.
Each sample contains three to five bulbs (about one pound) depending on
the size of the bulbs. Plant your garlic right away, following the
instructions in this booklet.
</P><P>
2) During the next summer, observe your garlic carefully as it grows and
fill in a Garlic Observation Form for each variety as characteristics
appear. Extra forms can be downloaded from our web site.
</P><P>
3) Harvest your garlic when it reaches maturity. See the instructions in
this booklet. Allow the garlic to cure for a few weeks. Again, make
careful observations and complete the Garlic Observation Form for each
of your varieties.
</P><P>
4) A project coordinator will contact you during the summer to help you
with any difficulties that you might have.
</P><P>
5) Send the completed Garlic Observation Forms to Seeds of Diversity's
office.
</P><P>
6) If you wish to grow additional varieties in your second and subsequent
years, you can choose from a list of varieties that will be available in late summer.
</P><P>
7) Repeat the process for a second year, with each variety. This is very
important, since garlic characteristics can be affected by a range of factors, including unusual weather.
</P>

<H3>What if Your Garlic Doesn't Grow?</H3>
<P>
No problem. Even the best gardeners have poor harvests from
time to time. Maybe the winter was too cold, or you had a
personal problem that prevented you from getting to your
garden.
</P><P>
Whatever the reason, as long as you want to keep volunteering
with the project, we want you back! Just contact Seeds of
Diversity's office. Our friendly coordinators can help you with
any difficulties and restore any samples that you need.
</P>
