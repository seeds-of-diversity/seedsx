<P>Bees are the most common pollinator, and the honeybee is the most important: the classic flower visitor.
There are, in fact, over 1000 native species of bees in Canada, but the honeybee is not native.

<P>
Honeybees were imported from Eurasia, where they have been domesticated for centuries. All of our &#0147;wild&#0148;
honeybees are from colonies that have escaped from domesticated hives over the years. Honeybees have easily adapted to life
in forests and wooded shelters throughout Canada, since they have the ability to generate heat to warm their hives during
winter. The success of honeybees lies in the same property that made them attractive to humans: their honey. Quite apart
from a creating a food product for humans, bees store their honey to feed themselves through the winter. Bees live
year-round, and their hives are self-sufficient as long as they collect enough nectar and pollen during summer to make
enough honey for the long Canadian winter.

<P>
Unfortunately, honeybees are under threat from many sides. Two types of parasitic mites have infested many honeybee hives
during the past few decades. Wild honeybees in Eastern Canada have been nearly exterminated by parasites, and the
infestation has spread to a large number of domestic hives. Add to this the losses of appropriate wild habitat, the effects
of pesticides in and around agricultural operations, and the transmission of other bacterial diseases from hive to hive,
and it is easy to appreciate why the honeybee population is clearly declining. Agriculture is in a vulnerable state to
depend so much on a single pollinator species, especially one that has only been introduced to Canada relatively recently.
