<H3>How to Be a Pollinator Observer</H3>
<P>
It's easy to be a Pollinator Observer.  Any time you see insects pollinating flowers, record the time, date, place and
the types and numbers of insects that you saw.  Even better, bring the Pollination Canada Observation Forms with you when you
garden, walk in the park, hike or go camping.
You can send your observations directly <A HREF='poll_submit.php'>online</A>,
or you can <A HREF='poll_submit.php'>mail</A> the forms
to <A href='http://www.seeds.ca/'>Seeds of Diversity's</A> office.
</P>
<P>
The key to providing useful information is to make repeated observations in the same location, whether it is your home
garden, a local park, or a roadside where you walk.  Annual observations are useful, monthly observations are even more
helpful.
</P>
<P>
First, download and read the <? i_href( "poll_manual" ) ?>Observer's Manual</A>.  It outlines the best practices for
finding and observing pollinating insects.
</P>
<P>
Then, download the <? i_href( "poll_forms" ) ?>Observation Forms</A>.  They help you to make clear and useful observations
step by step.  After a few sessions, you'll get the hang of it, and you'll start to notice an insect world around you that
you might not have really seen before!
