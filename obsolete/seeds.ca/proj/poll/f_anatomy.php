<H3>What's in a Flower?</H3>
<P><!-- <IMG src='img/f_anatomy.gif' width=250 height=250 align=right> -->
A flower is a plant's reproductive organ. Seeds are produced within fruit, and all fruit are formed at the bottoms of
flowers.
</P>
<P>
Some flowers have <B>female</B> characteristics.  They receive pollen, either by wind or insects, and create a
fruit containing seeds. The female part of a flower always has at least one <I>style</I>, a tubular structure that extends
outward from the base of the flower.  At the top of each style is a <I>stigma</I>, a little button-shaped cap that is
covered with tiny pores to admit pollen.  When insects visit the flower, they try to crawl inside to reach the sweet
nectar. Insects, such as bees, often have pollen stuck to their bodies, and when they brush pollen on the stigma,
pollination occurs.
</P>
<P>
Pollen travels down the style through <I>pollen tubes</I>, to the very bottom of the flower.  The female flower has an
ovary there, where the pollen combines with <I>ovules</I> (like egg cells in animals) to create brand new baby plants.
In most plants, each grain of pollen fertilizes one ovule, and creates one new seed which is a 50/50 genetic combination
of the mother plant (with the flower) and the father plant (where the pollen came from).
</P><P>
The ovary expands to form a fruit, the flower dries up and falls off, and the seeds mature.  You can often see the shape
of the tiny fruit at the base of the flower - the ovary is really the unfertilized fruit.
</P>
<P>
Some flowers have <B>male</B> characteristics.  They don't have a style, or an ovary.  They don't produce a fruit.  But
they make pollen.  The male part of a flower always has a number of <I>stamens</I>, slender supports with <I>anthers</I>
at their tops.  The anthers produce pollen.
</P>
<P>
Some flowers have <B>both</B> male and female organs.  This may seem strange to us, but for plants it's normal. When
stamens and styles are both present in a flower, we call that flower <I>complete</I>.  Plants are divided into families
on the basis of their flower shapes.  If one member of a plant family has complete flowers, then you'll find that all
members of that family do too.
</P>
<DL>
<DT>Complete flowers</DT>
<DD>Every flower has both male organs (stamens and anthers) and female organs (stigma, style and ovary).  Some are
self-compatible; able to pollinate themselves without any help (e.g. tomatoes, lilies, petunias).
Some are self-incompatible, requiring pollen to move from flower to flower (e.g. apples, pears).</DD>
<DT>Incomplete or monoecious flowers</DT>
<DD>Each plant has some female-only flowers and some male-only flowers.  Pollen must move from the male flowers to the
female flowers in order for seeds to be produced.  (e.g. corn, pumpkins).</DD>
<DT>Dioecious flowers</DT>
<DD>Plants are truly all-male or all-female.  Some plants only have male flowers, and some plants have only female flowers.
You need two plants (one of each) in order to get fruit, and the fruit only appear on the female plants.  (e.g. holly).</DD>
