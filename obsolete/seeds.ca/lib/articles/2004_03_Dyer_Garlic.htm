Diversity Canada (SoDC) recognizes garlic as a valuable genetic
resource.  Even though garlic cannot produce true seeds, a diversity
of distinct strains enjoys at least informal recognition from
growers. In keeping with SoDC’s mission, the best way to
protect this diversity is through promotion of garlic as a viable
garden crop for small-scale growers. Much more has been written about
the cooking and medicinal aspects than the cultivation of garlic,
perhaps because it is easy to grow and its food value is so great.
While these health benefits will be described in Appendix A, the main
focus of this paper is on growing garlic. The target audience is
anyone with an interest in gardening, either for home-use or profit,
but whose acquaintance with garlic may not go far beyond its use in
cooking. The aim is for more people to grow it. To this end, the
opening text introduces garlic’s history, habits, close
relatives and varieties. Although a few products that can be made for
sale are briefly described in Appendix B (‘Value added’),
this is not a cook book.
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">While a
consensus was evident among the many gardening sources that touch
briefly on garlic, a few key experts were heavily relied upon. Ron
Engeland’s “Growing Great Garlic” is the most
complete discussion of garlic as a commercial crop. But unfortunately
it relates to growing conditions of the north-west USA. For Ontario,
the experience built up by two growers, Paul Pospisil and Ted Maczka,
has been extensively tapped into here. Paul’s experience has
largely been packaged in ‘the Garlic Newsletter’, while
Ted contributed a half-day of discussions with the author. Both have
been regular presenters at numerous garlic festivals. The OMAFRA
factsheet on garlic provided a useful starting point, particularly
for diseases. Much of the context is prescriptive since space does
not permit exploration of all the reasoning behind each practice.

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Garlic is
the only easily-stored, living herb [13] and is both a food and a
medicine [11]. In southern Europe and Asia it is used as a cooking
herb in most dishes [12]. Compared to commercial drugs, it is safe,
inexpensive and readily available [11]. In spite of our long
historical association with garlic, the persistent odour (body and
breath) has relegated it to the vegetable of the peasant (stinking
rose), particularly in Northern Europe and England [28]. But that is
changing. Garlic production in the USA quadrupled between 1970 and
1995, with 90% being grown in California [13,28]. Garlic is now a
viable alternative for many tobacco growers in Ontario [31].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Canada is
an ideal climate for growing high quality garlic [17,28], partly
because northern-grown garlic produces fewer and larger cloves [21].
But garlic can be grown in most climates, in a wide variety of soils
and has few pests [11]. Although it is easy to grow [11],
home-plantings don’t always result in large bulbs [4]. For that
reason, this text will guide new growers in understanding, growing
and selling this amazing herb based on Ontario growing conditions. If
your garden is a hobby, growing garlic provides a fresh supply that
will benefit your health [5]. Since understanding those benefits is
valuable both growers and consumers, they will also be presented in
Appendix A.

<b>What is Garlic?</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>Garlic
history</b>: The origin of the English name was ‘gar leek’,
derived from Anglo-Saxon meaning ‘spear leek’ [11,13].
Garlic probably originated in Central Asia near Mongolia or
Afghanistan [9,11,28,30]. It spread to Eastern Europe and East Asia
with very early human migrations, covering an area roughly
duplicating the overland trade route from China to the Mediterranean
[9].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Garlic
bulbs were found in the tomb of Tutankhamen, placing them in Egyptian
history about 3,300 years ago [28]. They were part of the diet of the
Hebrew slaves who built the pyramids [10,18,28] and were mentioned in
the bible and the Odyssey [18]. From Egypt, they spread to the Middle
East and throughout the Roman Empire [18,30]. The ancient Chinese
took it as a guard against plagues [34]. The Crusaders brought it
back to France [30]. Garlic first came to North America with the
Spanish [13]. Albert Schweitzer treated many diseases with garlic
[18]. During both World Wars it earned the nick-name “Russian
penicillin” for the contribution of garlic poultices to
dressing wounds and treating infections, particularly gangrene
[18,28]. Prior to World War Two, garlic was the most frequently used
medicinal plant in Germany [13].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>How the
garlic plant grows</b>: The plant is larger than onion, growing two
to four feet with purple-white flowers on top [10,11]. The root, or
compound bulb, weighs typically six ounces and encapsulates between
four and 15 cloves, or sometimes more [31]. Each clove is wrapped in
a paper skin formed by two leaves [12,15,33] and weighs about a tenth
of an ounce [11]. The same skins wrap the bulb [15]. Cloves are
actually modified thickened leaves and each clove is technically a
bulb [2,9].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">The scape
is a simple smooth round stem that grows from the last single leaf,
coils at the tip and produces an umbel of small white infertile
flowers [5,15]. The true stem, however, stays below the bulb in the
ground and is small and flat [9]. Like the onion flower stalk, the
scape is solid, not hollow [31]. The bulbils produced by the
mushroom-like umbel vary in size and number [2,5]. A crop of bulbs
from bulbils takes two years since the full life cycle is biennial
[2,6,11]. By mid-summer each bulbil produces a small plant (one foot
or less), resembling young wheat or rye, with only four leaves, and a
small round, onion-like bulb (called a round) with no divisions
[5,16]. Fall-planted rounds will grow like a clove to produce a
normal bulb next year [5]. Both cloves and bulbils are vegetative
reproductive organs, or clones, rather than true seeds [2,5].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-top: 0.42cm; margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">
Since garlic has never been known to produce fertile seeds [31],
cross-pollinating (genetic exchange) to derive new varieties in the
classic plant breeding sense is not possible [2,21,25]. Mutation is
the only way that the many reported varieties could have come into
being. But garlic can false-mutate, fooling many growers into
thinking they have a new strain, only to discover that the desirable
features don’t repeat the next season [3,25]. True mutations
are actually quite rare, but in view of garlic’s long history
of migration with mankind, numerous regional strains evolved solely
by this process [9].

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>Relatives
of garlic</b>: Common or clove garlic (<i>Allium sativum</i>) shares
many growing characteristics and food qualities with other alliums
[15]. They are all in the lily (Liliaceae) family [10,30]. Being
monocots [31], all members of this family have similar leaves with
parallel venation [33] and resemble corn plants when newly emerged
[5]. The compound bulb is unique to garlic, however [9,12]. Other
domesticated Alliums include Shallots, Onion, Scallions, Leek and
Chives [4,28]. Wild garlic (<i>A. longicuspis</i>) is recognized as a
separate species from domestic garlic, although it is the wild
ancestor of clove garlic [9,20]. A species of garlic (<i>Allium
vineale</i> L.) grows as a perennial weed in Ontario [31].

	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Onions
	(<i>Allium cepa</i>) are from the Middle East and are now grown all
	over the world [28]. The same allyl sulphides, and enzymes in garlic
	are in onions in lower quantities. In addition there are flavones
	and Vitamins A, B and C. They are the best known alliums.

	are edible. The single stem is topped by an umbel of white or light
	red flowers [15]. Leeks are much like onions in appearance and
	properties and are cultivated everywhere as a vegetable with the
	young leaves and lower, tender white parts used [28].

	be preserved and the rest of the plant used fresh. The best use is
	as a salad green, vegetable or in soup. Bear’s Garlic forms
	large colonies in damp woods or wooded ravines. The broad leaves
	resemble the Lily of the Valley [15]. The aerial plant parts are

	The aerial parts of the plants are used fresh or in a tincture as a
	diuretic and to soothe rheumatism, asthma and gout. It is not in the

	<li><p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Elephant
	Garlic (<i>Allium ampeloprasum</i>) is not a true garlic, but is
	closely related to leeks [2,9,20]. It produces bulbs up to a pound
	[1] with three or four very large cloves the size of eggs and a very
	large seed stalk used by florists [12,20]. Elephant garlic often has
	bulblets (or corms) embedded in the scales or attached to the large
	main bulbs [20]. Corms at the base of the bulb can planted to
	produce a small onion-like bulb that can be planted to grow a
	compound bulb the next year. Elephant garlic cultivation is almost
	the same as for common garlic, except that cloves are planted
	further apart (a foot) and a little deeper [12,20]. Although it is
	unsuitable for dehydrating, the lower seed stalk is used in oriental
	cooking [20]. It is slightly more bitter than common garlic, with a
	flavour described as more delicate [1,20] and is mild enough to be
	served as a regular vegetable or sliced into a salad [12]. Elephant
	Garlic yields are low, returning only two to three pounds per pound
	planted [1,20]. It is not well suited to northern climates [21].

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">The number
of garlic varieties or strains in the world is considered to range
from 30 to 600 [1,9,16,20,21,28]. They are named in common, rather
than scientific, terms [3]. Modern garlic is best described as having
two sub-species: softneck (<i>sativum</i>) and its ancestor, hardneck
(<i>ophioscorodon</i>) garlic, also called top setting, or Ophio
garlic [9]. All garlic strains fit into five varietal groups (as
follows), including two softneck and three hardneck. [2,9,17,21,22].
Some softnecks, however, seem to include throw-backs that produce
scapes under stress [20,21].</p>

Only hardneck varieties consistently produce bulbuls, while softneck
(non-bolting) garlic bulbs have outer rings of larger cloves that
enclose clusters of smaller, sliver-like cloves [2,5]. Hardneck
garlic usually has just one layer of cloves since the plant resources
from the inner cloves are transported to the top in hardneck garlic
[5,16]. The outer skin of top setting garlic is streaked with purple,
and inner sheathing may be from purple to mauvish tan [5].<b>
</b>Hardneck garlic requires a cold winter for high vigour and
quality [9].

Rocambole, also called Serpent garlic, or German Red, was considered
by some botany experts to be a separate species (<i>Allium
scorodoprasum</i>) [1,5,9], although now all garlic varieties have
been put in one species [12]. Rocambole performs best in cold
climates but requires fertile soil [9]. Some Rocambole, including
Roja (and some other hardneck types), typically have brown to reddish
cloves in blotchy purple wrappers and a coiled scape [20]. Porcelain
is a very tall plant with large, tight, paper-white, shiny cloves,
and includes Ontario’s Music strain [20,21]. Porcelain yields
higher than Rocambole [21]. Purple stripe is also known as Asiatic
[9], but in this discussion the name ‘Asiatic’ refers to
a sub-variety of the softneck Artichoke that has reverted to hardneck
features [22].

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">The name
‘Artichoke’ has been used to describe all softnecks and
‘Rocambole’ to describe all hardnecks in other sources
[3,5,29]. Silverskin can have few or many cloves, and can vary in
colour from all white, tan or purple tinged, and rarely if ever
produces scapes [20].<b> </b>Artichoke produces 12 to 14 cloves, and
is the most common softneck in North America [9,21]. Silverskin, also
called Mild French, or Italian (the latter term has become
misleading) and is a good keeper, but doesn’t like cold [9,21].
Softneck garlic evolved from hardneck garlic before recorded history
[9].

commercially-grown garlic [5], these garlics are generally better
suited to Ontario’s colder climate [21].<b> </b>They are easier

them apart as ‘garlic’ rather than just hot [5,9]. A

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Planting
and cultivating garlic is very close to growing other alliums
[6,12,15]. While this paper is not exclusively organic, top-quality
garlic production lends itself to organic practices [1,27], at least
on a small-scale. The fundamentals of organic garlic production
growing include composting with organic waste, mulching, managing
soil to keep it healthy, controlling weeds and insects with natural
ways like rotation, hand-weeding and tillage, instead of with
pesticides [27]. Garlic should return eight to 12 times the cloves
planted [1]. There are four common reasons why Ontario growers may
only harvest small bulbs [23].

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>Seed
bed preparation</b>: The site for your garlic plot needs full sun and
a water supply for irrigating [22] with well-drained, rich, sandy or
sandy loam soils [10,17,21,22,34]. But almost any soil can be used if
amended with lots of manure, or if it has high organic matter with
micro-organisms [10,17,22]. Highly organic soil retains moisture and
nutrients and is friable, which gives growing bulbs room to expand
[2,10,20].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Soil
preparation should start one year ahead [9,27]. Soil pH should be
kept at 6.0 to 7.5 [20,22]. The soil should be well tilled (plowed or
roto-tilled) [21], then tramped down again after planting [5].
Sub-soil tilling can be done with a single chisel plow to 18 inches
run between the rows to loosen and aerate the soil [5]. For finer
textures, raised beds promote better drainage and earlier thawing
[1,22]. The soil can be built up by working in compost, animal
manure, green manure and legumes [1,9,22,27]. Animal manure should be
pre-composted [9]. Buckwheat is a useful green manure in rotation
with garlic because it reaches a full cover in six weeks and can be
grown between mid-summer harvesting and fall [5,9,21]. Green manures
also function as fertility indicators, since their poor performance
would be less costly than a poor garlic crop [9].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>Soil
Fertility</b>: Garlic is a heavy user of nitrogen, requiring 70 to
125 kg/ha [2,4,6]. Nitrogen should be applied once at fall planting
and at three week intervals after growth starts again in spring, with
the last application four to six weeks before harvest [2,5], or at 2,
4 and 6 leaf stages [21]. The most important application is in early
spring [9]. Chemical fertilizer can be applied by foliar spray a day
or two after a rain or irrigation [9,27]. Maintaining good soil humus
will ensure that nitrogen is not leached out [9]. Since it is a root
crop, garlic demands potassium but needs less phosphorous than other
vegetables [4]. Wood ashes for potassium, bone meal for phosphorous
and blood meal for nitrogen all make good organic fertilizers
[9,17,22]. Well rotted compost can make up needed nitrogen [4,33].
Manure should be applied between rows, not side-dressed since cloves
will rot if manure is too close [6,9,17].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>When to
plant</b>: Most garlic is winter-hardy [10] and is best grown in
Ontario as a winter annual [2]. Yields for spring-planted garlic are
only two thirds of fall-planted garlic and have only half the leaf
area, which is highly correlated with bulb diameter [31].
Spring-planting must be done five weeks before the last frost, to get
the mid-summer solar energy [6,11,12]. Hardneck varieties need cold
before the bulbs can form and would require refrigeration if
spring-planted [2]. The best time to plant is two to three weeks
before freeze-up [6,17] to ensure the month of temperatures just
above freezing (0-10<sup>o</sup>C) and the three or four months of
dormancy that it needs before summer growth [1,9]. Earlier fall
planting can sometimes raise yields [20], but planting too late in
fall does not give roots enough time to start growing [9].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>Over-wintering
your crop</b>: Although fall-planted cloves may send up two to four
leaves, they only need to sprout and start some roots before winter
[2,21]. Fall-planted garlic can withstand late snow or frost in
spring [4,5]. Bulb and clove sizes depend on earlier vegetative
growth and a period of cold, below 18<sup>o</sup>C, to break their
dormancy [4,20,21]. The scape and bulb segregation (budding) develop
only after a cold treatment of 5<sup>o</sup>C for eight weeks
[20,31].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">A good
snow cover is usually essential to prevent frost penetration and
winter-kill<b> </b>[2,17]. The main weather hazard in Ontario is
winter freeze-thaw, usually during the January thaw [21,22].
Winter-kill only happens if both the clove and roots freeze [9]. Some
post-emergence snow won’t hurt garlic [17]. In Ontario
fall-planted cloves should be well covered with mulch, such as four
to six inches of clean straw (thicker mulching further north), to
protect it from freezing and fluctuating low temperatures
[4,6,17,19,21]. Mulching sooner can cause mold [19] or before the
first frost will allow mice to take shelter under it [21]. Old mulch
can be worked into the soil [27].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>Planting</b>:
Cloves should be planted one to two inches deep (from soil surface to
tip), three to six inches apart and in rows from eight to 16 inches
apart [1,2,10,33].<b> </b>Planting can be a little deeper further
north (near Ottawa) because of greater frost-penetration [21,33]. A
recommended guideline is to plant Porcelain strains at six inch
spacing and other types at four inches [22]. Another rough guide is
that a half pound of seed cloves should plant a 100 foot row [10].<b>
</b>Seeding can be a bit heavier in case of injury [5] or if the soil
is very fertile [9]. Wider row spacing allows easier weeding and more
sun penetration, whereas rows two feet or more, may be needed for
machine harvesting [19]. A Canadian company, BDK Fabrication (240
Argyle St., Delhi, ON, N4B 2W8), supplies a mechanized planter for
garlic and shallots [20].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Planting
more densely, both within rows and between rows, can increase yields,
although cost of planting also increases<b> </b>[34]. But planting
closer within rows reduces bulb sizes slightly [34] so yield ratios
may go down. Even though garlic will still emerge if not planted
upright [5], the cloves should be planted base down for better yields
[6,16,17,22]. Since cloves should also be pushed to the bottom of the
hole and the soil pressed in to avoid air pockets, hand-planting is
more effective [9,16,19,22].<b> </b>A properly-spaced pattern of
holes can be quickly created by making a board with rows of dowels
protruding downward, to be pressed into the seed bed by standing on
it<b> </b>[19]. For your own seed, bulbs must be cracked, or popped,
by hand just before planting and never tossed or dropped so that
cloves are not damaged or bruised [2,5,9,21,22].<b> </b>Planting
cloves should have as much skin left on as possible [17]. Damaged or
un-healthy cloves must never be planted because they may carry
diseases, including white rot, basal rot and nematodes [16,20,22].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Popping
cloves, the critical step before planting, was described in “Growing
Great Garlic” [9]. For hardneck bulbs, start by running a
thumbnail around the woody stem just above the cloves. Then twist the
stem to loosen the cloves and break the outer wrappers. Applying
thumb pressure downward and outward from the stem will sluff off
cloves. A successfully popped clove will have a dark, crusty, dry
base (portion of the true stem) and be fully wrapped. Without these,
the plant won’t start with a full root system and will be prone
to infection. Suspicious looking bulbs should be disposed of without
being popped when handling seed cloves. Softneck bulbs are harder to
pop because there is no stem to twist, there are more layers of
cloves and more total cloves. But the principle is the same.

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>Selecting
planting stock</b>: Seed quality is next to good cultural practices
in importance [26].<b> </b>Varieties are region and soil-specific, so
varieties not adapted to the climate won’t grow successfully in
Ontario [4,23].<b> </b>Varieties adapted to mild climates and then
grown in cold climates often do not perform well and usually develop
a very "hot" flavor [29]. Ordering seed from far-away seed
companies usually fails because they often send varieties adapted to
lower latitudes that do not exploit longer photoperiods or tolerate
cold [4,20,21]. Since there is no standardization, some garlic seed
producers will rename particular varieties, leading to more confusion
[29]. A grocery store is not a good place to find garlic for planting
[4,12,23] because these bulbs are stored for food use, as well as
imported from other climates [21].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Canadian
growers should save part of their own bulbs for seed to ensure they
will survive the northern winter [1,26]. New growers should search
for strains that have been proven in Ontario, and their region [25]
and remember that some suppliers (perhaps through wishful thinking)
may promote strains whose only unique feature is their name [3]. To
get to know garlic, try a few strains from the other varietal groups
before choosing one [4,23].<b> </b> No seed stock, however, can
replace sound farm practices and good weather [3,22].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">In
selecting seed, bulb size is more significant than clove size [9,22].
While some growers select the largest, as well as the best looking
bulbs for re-planting [4], experienced growers in Ontario advise that
the largest bulbs often make poor seed [16,22]. Don’t be
surprised if small bulbs occasionally produce large cloves [22].
Similarly, planting the largest cloves does not necessarily produce
the highest yield [9,16]. Medium cloves generate the best economic
returns, whereas the smallest cloves may not segment properly
[16,20]. For softneck<b> </b>varieties, plant only the outer cloves
[4]. For saving your own seed, set aside smallest bulbs, use the
largest for eating or selling, and select healthy mid-range size
bulbs for seeding. [22].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">With more
experience you can grow bulbils to get rejuvenated seed cloves. This
means allowing some scapes to grow, planting the bulbils, and
harvesting and replanting the rounds [26]. Planting bulbils leads to
rejuvenation and produces a healthier next generation [21]. Since the
rounds must be harvested and re-planted, growing from bulbils can
take up to five years [21]. Like seed cloves, bulbils should be
planted an inch deep and away from neighbouring bulbils [1].<b> </b>If
planting bulbils, select the largest [5].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>Getting
better yields:</b> Garlic takes from 100 to 120 growing days from
planting to maturity [4]. The most ideal weather for fall-planted
garlic includes a moderately cold winter with good snow cover, good
spring and fall rain, and hot sunny summer days with cool nights [9].
Optimum root growth, leaf growth after sprouting and scape emergence
happens at temperatures from 15 to 25<sup>o</sup>C, but root growth
will continue below 3<sup>o</sup>C [30,31]. Mulch moderates soil
conditions all year [9]. In spring, winter mulch can be partly and
gently pulled back to allow the soil to warm up and any weeds poking
through the mulch should be pulled then as well [24]. Summer mulch
keeps the crop cool, the soil moist and slows weed growth [10,21,19].
Leaves can be used as a mulch in the paths [1]. Sawdust and animal
manure are poor mulches [9]. Sawdust steals nitrogen, retains water
that can keep near-surface plant tissue too wet and takes two years
to properly decay when tilled under. Animal manure also retains water
and can cause molds.
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Garlic
doesn’t like competition [17], so routine weed control (by
hand, cultivation or spraying) is needed [2,6,12]. Organic methods of
weed control are well suited to garlic growers [24]. Mechanized
cultivation can replace hand-weeding in larger plots and leaves only
the weeds near the rows [27]. Cultivation is best done after
emergence and before roots spread too far [5]. Weeds should also be
dug up in mid-September [1]. Pre-planting tillage can expose annual
weeds, which can then be tilled in after they emerge and before they
go to seed [9,27]. This is an essential weed control strategy in
virgin soil [9].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Scapes
allowed to mature can reduce bulb yields [31]. Early scape removal
improves yields and bulb development, but removing them after they
uncurl reduces bulb growth [2,10,20,34]. Cutting back the scapes
diverts energy to the roots and cloves. Whereas in South eastern
Ontario, scapes should be broken in early June [17], they may not
appear before late June in the Ottawa Valley [21]. Removing scapes
mechanically (cutter bar) can be costly because loosing more than one
leaf will usually lower bulb size [34].</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>Irrigation</b>:
Garlic is drought-sensitive and irrigation is often required
[2,5,10]. Moisture stress triggers early bulb development, causing
smaller cloves and bulbs, as well as bulb shattering at harvest [20].
Although soil type does not affect the total water used (rain or
irrigation), coarse (sandy) or shallow soils need watering more
frequently [5,20]. In heavy clay soils that can store more water,
irrigation has little benefit, however [34]. One or two inches of
added water per week, or trickle irrigation with a soaker hose, is
usually cost-effective [2,16,21]. Because sunflowers wilt ahead of
other plants under water stress, they can be planted as indicators of
when to water garlic [24]. Otherwise, soil that can be pressed into a
ball that doesn’t crumble has enough moisture, but it has too
much if water can be squeezed out of the ball [9]. Irrigation should
stop about three weeks to a month before harvesting [2,17,19], or
when leaves go yellow and the tops become dry and begin to fall over
[19,20].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>Pests
and diseases</b>:<b> </b>If plant clusters in early spring have whole
leaves turning yellow, and winter kill, water-related stress or
fertilizer burn can be ruled out,<b> </b>they<b> </b>are likely
diseased and should be pulled [9].<b> </b>An OMAFRA factsheet has
described pests and diseases affecting Ontario garlic [2]. The main
problems include Fusarium basal rot, Penicillium mould and viruses.
Fusarium is a soil-borne fungus that thrives in wet, warm soil and
destroys garlic roots. The first symptoms are yellowing of the tip
and shoot die-back in spring. Penicillium is a problem during storage
where blue-green mould appears at the base of the bulb, particularly
with damaged cloves.
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Viruses
infect almost all garlic, although most do no damage unless the crop
lacks soil moisture or fertility, or growth is slow [2,26,27]. Virus
symptoms include mosaic, flecking, streaking and mottling, or
distortion of leaves. If even one clove has a brown spot the virus
infection has probably spread to all cloves of the bulb [16].<b>
</b>Aphids can transmit viruses. Insect pests include onion maggot,
thrips and wire-warms [2]. Nematodes also attack garlic and can cause
shattering [17,20].<b> </b>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Un-healthy
or infected cloves must never be planted since that spreads
infections throughout the plot [2,9]. Planting too early in fall will
create conditions needed by clove rot [2]. Harvesting the driest
parts of the fields first will lower moulds [5]. In general, diseases
that affect other alliums will also affect garlic, so never plant
garlic after onions [2,4,16]. Garlic should always be grown in a
three-year rotation with a legume and top-growth plant like buckwheat
to deal with persistent soil spores [2,17,22,23]. To allow for the
three-year rotation, the growing area available should be three times
the area of the desired garlic plot [27]. A border planting of
Marigolds will deter many pests [17]. Compared to other crops,
however, garlic has few pests [4] and has been used as a barrier to
protect other crops [12,28,33].

alliums, but prefers leeks and onions, and may not pose a major
economic threat to garlic growers [16,21,24]. Up-to-date descriptions
of this pest have appeared in The Garlic Newsletter [24]. The larva
tunnel into leaf tissue, stems and, occasionally, into bulbs. They
can attack the scapes. The adults over-winter in buildings, hedges
and plant debris, and emerge when temperatures exceed 9.5<sup>o</sup>C.
Eggs are laid singly on lower leaf surfaces when night temperatures
stay above 12<sup>o</sup>C. They are a quarter inch (5-7 mm) long
with a half inch  (12-15 mm) wingspan. They appear reddish brown with
a white triangle and white mottling on their folded wings.
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Eggs are
white but difficult to see (0.4 mm). The larva are yellowish green
with gray-brown dots on all segments, with a pale brown head, and can
reach ½ inch (12 mm). The pupa is reddish brown and in a white
net-like cocoon. Unfortunately, the adult can be confused with
harmless, native carrion moths. Growers should learn to identify them
and inspect their crop after April temperatures exceed the above
threshold, as the scapes emerge (since the larva boring into them are
easily seen) and at harvest for damage, as well as cocoons and larva.
Spraying is ineffective since larva hatch continually, every day, and
bore into the plant right away. Earwigs appear to be an effective
bio-control and don’t affect garlic.

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>Harvesting</b>:
Harvesting is the most labour-intensive operation, and deciding when
to harvest is a critical decision [5], especially for hardnecks [9].
Bulbs harvested too early will be undersized, shrivel during curing
and won’t store well [2,5,25]. Bulbs harvested too late will be
prone to moulds and lose protective wrappers [2,17,25]. Hot dry
summer weather ripens the crop earlier while rainy weather delays
harvest [5]. Top setting garlic is more sensitive to harvest schedule
with a window of a week or less to harvest successfully [5,25].
Harvesting is usually about mid-July [11,17,21] and should be done on
a dry day [25]. If bulbs are typically ‘blossoming’
(opening up to expose cloves), or the leaves are all brown,
harvesting is probably a bit too late [9].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Garlic is
ready to harvest when the plant is half to three quarters yellow
[1,12,16], leaf tips begin to dry, discolour and bend [2,10,20,32]
and top growth begins to die down [4,33]. The bottom third of the
lower leaves may also be brown [17,25,29]. For selling fresh garlic,
harvesting can be a bit earlier (leaves with some green) to help
improve quality [20]. A mature bulb is swelled with thinner sheath
leaves and a few decomposed wrappers [2,25]. A few bulbs can be
pulled and cut in half as a field test to check if the cloves fill
the skins [29]. Breaking any tops not bent and yellow by mid-summer
can force all plants to mature together [10,12]. When harvesting by
hand, use a fork to loosen soil to eight to ten inches (20-25cm)
before pulling [2,5,17]. Garlic bruises easily and is poorly suited
to mechanical harvesting [23]. But if the scale of production
requires mechanized harvesting, softneck garlic is better, whereas
top setting is better for small, hand, or organic operations [16,25].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>Curing
and storing</b>: Between harvesting and either selling or consuming
at home, your crop will undergo a lot of handling. Because garlic is
fragile and bruises cause early decay [25], these chores must be well
understood. Before storing, garlic needs one to two weeks of curing
in a well-ventilated shed, protected from direct sunlight [1,25,32].
Curing is more critical the earlier or greener the plant was pulled
[9]. Harvested plants can be cured in covered, slotted racks or
vegetable bins, or hung in bunches, for air drying [2,11]. Some
preliminary curing, or drying, can be done outdoors, if the bulbs are
stacked so that they are covered with tops of other plants for
protection from the sun [10,32,33]. Even in Ontario, sunburn,
indicated by translucent yellow cloves [9], must be avoided.
Field-drying bulbs from wet ground may need trays put under them
[16].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">The
weather right after harvest must be dry because leaves will turn
black if the garlic plants are left too long in the harvest rack [5],
but drying bulbs too rapidly may cause shattering [20]. Most of the
dirt clinging to bulbs right after pulling will flake off after some
further drying [5]. Washing bulbs is only needed when grown in clay
[21,25]. An on-site work table with a water supply and shade are
helpful if bulbs need cleaning [25]. Peeling down the highest leaf
should take off enough skin to give the bulbs a shine, and still
leave the required four layers of un-broken wrappers [2,5,21,25]. Any
damaged or decayed leaves must be pulled off [25]. Tops should be
trimmed to one-half to one inch and roots to between one-quarter and
one-inch [10,23,25,32].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Bulbs can
then be stored in a cool, dark, well-ventilated place [1,9,10,23,32].
Storage racks can be made with chicken wire for better circulation
[5]. Dampness will cause rot in stored bulbs [12]. Although braids
store best, trimmed ready-to-use bulbs can store well if kept in a
single layer, but not as well in bags [23]. Garlic intended for
eating should be stored at 0<sup>o</sup>C to 2<sup>o</sup>C (32-35<sup>o</sup>F)
with 60-70% RH [2,4,20,,27,31]. Keeping relative humidity lower for
garlic than for other vegetables will avoid molds and retard root
growth [20]. Kept cool and well ventilated, garlic will keep from six
months to a year [12,20], although storage times vary among different
strains and varieties [23]. Harvested garlic should be stored away
from other vegetables because the garlic odour is easily transferred
[27].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Seed
cloves are best stored at just above 50<sup>o</sup>F (10<sup>o</sup>C)
and 65-70% RH [20] and should not be refrigerated [20,23]. Since
garlic sprouts (breaks dormancy) easily between 5<sup>o</sup>C and
10<sup>o</sup>C (40<sup>o</sup>F and 50<sup>o</sup>F), storage in
this temperature range should be avoided [20,27,31]. Seed cloves
stored below 5<sup>o</sup>C (40<sup>o</sup>F) produce rough bulbs
while storage above 65<sup>o</sup>F delays sprouting and maturity
[20]. For either use, storing near heat dries out the bulbs, in
sunlight promotes sprouting, and in dampness starts mould [23].

<b>Getting your Garlic to Market</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Far more
garlic is consumed in Ontario than is grown [31]. Garlic prices
during the winter of 2002/2003 ranged from $4.00 to $6.00 per lb
[23]. It is used in most ethnic, Asian, Chinese, Mediterranean and
Eastern European, cooking [11]. Due to Canada’s growing ethnic
populations, this garlic consumption is increasing [21]. Rediscovery
of garlic’s health benefits has also put it back on the table
for all North Americans. Public interest in any organically grown
food is also increasing. To sell organic garlic, you must obtain
certification from an organic certification organization [27].
Producer groups that can certify quality and establish grades can
enhance sales of all members, organic or conventional [9]. Therefore
anyone intending to sell garlic is advised to join the Garlic Growers
Association of Ontario (GGAO).
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Since so
much selling by small-scale growers is at a farmers markets or
face-to-face, here are a few tips [8,23]. Greet customers cheerfully,
display prices clearly, present clean, healthy garlic (and other
products). Situate yourself and your produce at the rear of your
booth so that customers can come into the shade, or out of the rain.
Don’t smoke or get caught eating when customers come. Know your
varieties, know your product and don’t under-price. Knowing the
product means believing that it will benefit the customer and
appreciating the health benefits well enough to introduce them
effortlessly to discussions with customers [8]. To enhance this
face-to-face selling skill, garlic’s health benefits are
reviewed in Appendix A. Small-scale growers with hopes of selling for
profit should also prepare a business plan [7]. For garlic growers,
the business plan must balance the garlic crop with other vegetables,
as well as outlining the customer base and ways to add value [23].
Value added options are reviewed in Appendix B.
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Because
there is sharp drop in quality after six months [5], fresh garlic is
only marketable from mid-July to the end of December [4]. However,
scapes, garlic scallions and greens can be sold from early May,
supplementing grower incomes by as much as one quarter [21,25,31].
Scapes must be picked while they are still curling (before they get
woody) and kept in plastic bags in the fridge [17]. In early June
they can still be easily snapped off at the white spot when they are
six to eight inches high [16,25]. Damaging leaves while harvesting
scapes can lead to decreased bulb yield, however [17,34]. Scaping by
hand should take several passes [25].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">While most
of Ontario is not warm enough for spring-planted garlic to produce
mature bulbs, spring-planted cloves can be harvested in late spring
and early summer as garlic scallions or a green onion substitute
[17,24]. For this use of smaller cloves or thinned plants, smaller
cloves can be spaced a little closer than normal [17,21]. To sell
very young whole plants, any dirt or dead leaves must be removed
[25]. Bulbils can also be planted for a harvest of shoots like baby
onions, and remain succulent longer than clove greens, but they
should be well watered [9,17].

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>

<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>Summary</b></p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Although
it is sexually infertile, garlic embodies the sort of crop to which
SoDC has directed its efforts. It is ideally suited to small-scale
and low-input production, and growers can be self-sufficient in seed
stock. Since Canada is not a centre or origin or diversity for
garlic, any variety or strain that can be grown is potentially
‘heritage’, and deserving of conservation efforts.
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">The first
priority of a new grower is to find, select and plant the right seed
stock. Ontario garlic growers should plant in the fall, so garlic
strains that are not winter-tolerant are not good choices. The second
priority is establishing and preparing the site for the garlic plot.
Enough space is needed to allow a three-year rotation. Because garlic
is not a typical garden plant, even experienced growers need to adapt
to the set of practices described above if they are new to garlic
cultivation. Finally new growers can help conserve the diversity of
garlic types available to Canadian growers by contributing to the
body of information to be stored in the database proposed in Appendix
C. New garlic growers should join the GGAO if they intend to sell
their product, and they may want to subscribe to the Garlic
Newsletter, as well.</p>

<b>Appendix A: Health Benefits of Garlic</b>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">To list
garlic’s health benefits is to appreciate why it accompanied
mankind’s prehistoric migrations across Asia and Europe. Over
2000 scientific papers on garlic are now supporting the traditional
knowledge about this herb [14]. Most of this research has been done
in India, China and the Soviet Union [1]. The German Health Ministry
has recognized garlic as a medicine to prevent age-related
circulation diseases since the more garlic a nation consumes, the
less heart disease it suffers [11]. In spite of spending more money
on health care, North Americans rank lower than a dozen other nations
in life-expectancy, because of diseases of affluence [14]. So it is
not surprising that there is growing interest in garlic for its
health benefits. The lack of patent protection for commercial garlic
products [1] means a new opportunity for small-scale growers.
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>What
garlic does</b>: Garlic lowers bad cholesterol (LDL) and regulates
good (HDL) cholesterol [11,12,14]. It works immediately to dispose of
fat in meals, slows down liver production of cholesterol and moves
cholesterol into the blood stream to be metabolized as energy
[11,18,28]. It thins blood more safely than aspirin by normalizing
blood clotting, reduces blood pressure and reduces heart attacks
[11,12,18,28,29]. Garlic builds the immune system by enhancing
inflammatory cells, stimulating natural killer cells to attack tumor
cells, virus-infected cells and other invaders, and promoting
macrophages that engulf foreign bodies [14,18,28]. Garlic helps rid
the body of toxins, heavy metals and radiation damage [14,28]. Garlic
is more useful to prevent cancer than to treat it, but it stops
cancer cells from proliferating [11]. Along with other alliums,
garlic is associated with reduced stomach, bladder and liver cancer
[14,18]. Garlic fights bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa and
parasites, either directly or by stimulating the immune system
[11,12,18]. Garlic has almost no side effects compared to
antibiotics, which compromise the immune system and are
bacteria-specific [11,12]. For serious infections however, such as
when there is a fever, garlic is not a substitute for modern drugs
[11].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Garlic is
consumed in tinctures, oils, decoctions, wine, vinegar, garlic juice,
by maceration, cooking, or fresh, as well as being incorporated into
pharmaceutical products [12,29]. All forms have antioxidant and blood
thinning effects, and can reduce high blood pressure, but raw garlic,
chopped or crushed, is the strongest medicinal form [12,33]. Before
modern medicine, garlic gave protection against amoeboid dysentery,
typhoid and other infectious diseases [29]. When cooked in honey and
vinegar, it expels tapeworms and other parasites [1]. For antibiotic
use and blood sugar control, fresh chopped or macerated garlic oil,
garlic juice fresh or aged, or garlic powder are effective [12]. A
cotton ball soaked in garlic oil will treat ear infections [33].
Garlic tea is a laxative [15]. A water-based cold extract treats
asthma [15]. Fresh garlic crushed in hot lemon will help fight
infections [11]. Garlic wine can treat a cold or flu, [12]. Bulbils
can be chewed for coughs [1,16].</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Side-effects
are mild digestive discomfort when eaten fresh, and some eczema when
handling [11]. Too much fresh garlic can harm the digestive tract,
burn mucous membranes of the mouth, throat and stomach, damage red
blood cells, interfere with liver function and destroy friendly
bacteria [18]. Cooking garlic removes its toxicity [18], whereas
un-cooked garlic products kept for more than a month can carry
botulism, unless cloves are soaked in vinegar [23]. Taking garlic
with peppermint, mint tea, fennel, parsley or lettuce, cranberry
juice or milk will fight garlic breath [11,17]. Regular consumption
also results in less body odour [17]. The maze of commercial garlic
products that avoid garlic smell do provide some of the long-term
benefits described above [11].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>Biochemistry
and constituents</b>: Although garlic has partnered humanity since
the dawn of civilization, deciphering how it worked did not start
until the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century [18]. In 1844 a German chemist
identified an oil constituent in garlic oil he called allyl. Then in
1892 another German chemist used steam distillation to identify the
garlic odour-causing compounds diallyl disulfide, trisulfide and
polysulfides. Allicin, the signature constituent of garlic, was
discovered in 1944 by soaking garlic in ethyl alcohol. Four years
later, allianase, garlic’s chief enzyme, was discovered. But it
is still difficult to isolate a single health-benefit compound from
garlic [12]. Cutting, chopping or crushing garlic cloves activates
the enzymes which release about 100 proteins and sulfur compounds,
mostly from allicin [1,11,29]. Allianase converts alliin, which has
no odour or antibacterial properties, to allicin, which is unstable
and not directly active in the body [1,28,29]. More than half the
alliin in raw garlic is lost during most manufacturing processes
[18].</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Garlic
cloves are about 6% protein, including sulfur bearing amino acids
known as S-allyl compounds [28]. Garlic oil contains diallyl
sulfides, allicine and vitamins A B1, B2 and nicotylamide [29]. Other
beneficial constituents of garlic include vitamin C thiamin and
riboflavin, phosphorus and sulfur, and trace elements zinc, tin,
calcium, potassium, aluminum, germanium and selenium [1,15].
Cholesterol synthesis by the liver is lowered by ajoene derivatives
and a range of diallyl sulfides, and many of the latter compounds
function as antioxidants [12]. Garlic contains about 17 special
sugars which promote the growth of beneficial enteric (gut) bacteria,
along with nucleosides that actually help build DNA and so promote
longevity and cellular rejuvenation [28]. The garlic compounds,
ajoene and diallyl sulfide, among others, protect against aflotoxins,
a mold contaminant found in peanuts, rice, grains, beans, corn and
sweet potatoes [14]. Selenium helps detoxify the body and combat
aging, germanium is needed to oxygenate the blood [28], and both show
promise in treating cancer [1,18]. S-allyl cysteine and
mercaptocysteine break-down and rid the body of toxins in sweat and
bile [11,18]. The allyl compounds and sulfides in garlic oil fight
cancer, but they also cause well-known garlic breath and body odour
as they pass through the lungs and skin from the blood stream
[12,28,29].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Garlic oil
extracts and aged garlic do not contain allicin and are weaker
medicinally than raw garlic, but retain some cholesterol-lowering,
detoxifying and tonic properties [12]. Distilling garlic oils leaves
the non-volatile compounds behind [18]. Since heat destroys allicin,
its persistence in the body depends on the means of preservation
[12]. Crushing and mixing it with water, vinegar or wine preserves
allicin. Soaking for three to six hours preserves some allicin along
with many derivatives. Soaking for two or three days gets rid of
allicin (and irritating effects). Garlic powder, made by low
temperature drying of garlic slices and put it into gelatin capsules
or honey pills, preserves allicin, provides antifungal protection and
stops yeast (<i>Candida albicans</i>) [11,14].

</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>Home
made products</b>: Small-scale growers can make and sell an array of
products, including syrups, tinctures, tea, vinegar, spreads and
oil-based mixes [28]. Extracting garlic oil by soaking chopped cloves
in vegetable oil gets constituents not available in raw garlic
[11,12]. For an oil spread, chop cloves with parsley, crush the
mixture and add enough vegetable oil to cover it, and use it the next
day [12]. Mixing garlic with olive oil in a blender will accomplish
the same goal [17]. Garlic oil can be made by peeling and quartering
six cloves into jar with two cups of extra virgin olive oil. After
standing for three days, the cloves are removed and the oil can be
kept in the fridge a month or two before going oil rancid [27].
Scapes have more oil than cloves [21] and can be sold as a puree with
olive oil to be spread on a cracker, put into jellies and pickles
[17,25].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">A tincture
is made by finely chopping a bulb into a pint of high alcohol liquor
(vodka, brandy, brandy or gin), steeping for two or three weeks and
turning two or three times a day [12,15]. For ‘fish lake fire
water’, puree garlic and pour vodka over it [16]. To make
garlic wine, blend four cloves with a cup of wine and let stand for
three hours [12]. For garlic vinegar, peel, chop and crush a bulb
into a quart of red wine or cider vinegar, let sit for two weeks, and
strain through cloth [12]. Garlic salt that will last about a month
can be made by peeling and halving six cloves with one cup of salt,
combining in a class jar, and shaking two to three times a day for a
week [27]. To make garlic powder, dry thin slices at 43<sup>o</sup>C
(110<sup>o</sup>F) for three days, grind it and then keep it in small
herb jar for sale.
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Several
garlic syrups are also easy to make. The first syrup can be made by
covering crushed garlic with cider vinegar and water, leaving a few
days and straining [1]. The second garlic syrup is an expectorant
made with one pint of boiling water, two ounces finely chopped
garlic, which is covered and left to stand for 10 hours before
straining [33]. After adding four tablespoons of honey and one
tablespoon of vinegar to this liquid, refrigerate and take four
teaspoons per day. One other garlic syrup is made by alternating
layers of chopped or sliced garlic with dry sugar or raw unheated
honey [12]. After steeping for two days the sugar pulls the fluid out
of the garlic. Then strain the juice through cloth.
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">Cooking
usually means sautéing in a small amount of oil to add to meat
or other foods [12]. It is especially popular in Mediterranean
cooking [15]. Garlic and parsley go well with fish or red meat, and
crushed garlic and dill can be added to cheese curds [11]. Decoction,
which releases several specific sulfur-based by-products, involves
chopping and simmering in a covered pan at very low heat, then
letting sit to cool to room temperature [12]. A Middle Eastern dip
consists of olive oil, squeezed lemons, garlic and marjoram, and can
be added to pastas, rice or fried dishes [11]. Chopping several
cloves into a quart of boiling water makes a garlic tea [33]. Garlic
can also be used as an insect repellant [15].</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><b>Garlic
braids</b>: Garlic braids can bring much higher prices than regular
eating garlic [5]. [19] Here is a simple explanation of pigtail
braiding [19]. Start with three garlic plants. Cross two plant stems
under the middle bulb and stem, twist or fold each crossed stem back
across, then add another plant as each fold is completed. Tear away
excess leaves as further bulbs are added. After the first cross, the
first stem should be twisted back like those being added. Up to three
stems will be folded in from one side, before folding stems from the
other side. Usually three groups of two stems will be handled at
once. Stems must be long enough to not protrude part way up stem and
facilitate about 12 bulbs per braid. Bulbs should be prepared by
peeling off outer skins and cutting away roots without nicking the
bulbs. A variety of other dried decorative plants, herbs, flowers or
coloured wool can be worked in to decorate the display [5,19].
Earlier harvesting can make braiding easier [20]. Top setting garlic
types can only be pigtail braided if freshly harvested and not too
mature [19].
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">An easier
approach for hardneck garlic is to lash them into a bundle, or
string-braiding [19,25]. This simpler approach involves setting a
starter knot on the first garlic stem near the bulb, add a pair of
long-stemmed garlic along side and just a bit higher and secure them
with a half-hitch, then a fourth in the grove that these two create,
secured with another half-hitch to the main bundle, and so on. Some
stems may need to be cracked as you tighten the bundle and the best
results are with three quarter cured plants. For a more detailed
explanation see the garlic newsletter (June, 2003).</p>

<b>Appendix C: Garlic Growers' Registry</b>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US"><br>
</p>
<p class="western" style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" lang="en-US">The last
task of this paper is to outline a garlic growers' registry. The aim
of the registry (database questionnaire) is for growers to interact
and exchange production or variety-related information. It will
answer the question of what strains growers consider to be thriving
in Canada, rather than what suppliers advertise. The results and
experiences compiled through the registry will be shared with GGAO,
where appropriate permission is obtained from each participating
grower. The design of this registry is a direct result of the above
research and review. Grower records should interface with the
Database of Growing Conditions prepared for SoDC in 2000 since that
database design incorporates grower personal data and links the
grower location with agro-ecological data, including the National
Ecological Framework for Canada. Therefore questions to create grower
identification and location records are not duplicated here. The
registry will be brief and will focus on grower purpose, growing
practices, and seed selection.
