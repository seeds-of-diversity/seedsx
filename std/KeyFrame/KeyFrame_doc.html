<H3>What is KeyFrame?</H3>
<P>
KeyFrame provides advanced services for applications that manipulate database records, especially interactive web
applications that use online forms.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>Accept form data (via GET or POST), validate types, and prepare for database record insertion. Ideal for applications
that use HTML forms to enter/edit database records. Forms can relate to one table, or a multi-table relation.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>A Basic Example</H3>
<P>
Here's a simplified example to give you an idea of what KeyFrame does. Say you have a table of people like this:
</P>
<TABLE cellpadding='20'><TR><TD valign='top'>

<TABLE cellpadding='5' border='1'>
<TR><TH colspan='3' style='background-color:#AAAAAA'>keyframe_example_people</TH></TR>
<TR><TD align='center' valign='top'><B>_key</B><BR/><BR/><I>INTEGER<BR/>PRIMARY_KEY</I></TD>
    <TD align='center' valign='top'><B>name</B><BR/><BR/><I>TEXT</I></TD>
    <TD align='center' valign='top'><B>age</B><BR/><BR/><I>INTEGER</I></TD></TR>
<TR><TD>1</TD><TD>Alice</TD><TD>40</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>2</TD><TD>Bob</TD><TD>39</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>3</TD><TD>Cathy</TD><TD>37</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>4</TD><TD>Dave</TD><TD>42</TD></TR>
</TABLE>

</TD><TD valign='center'>
You can describe this table with this KeyFrame Relation Definition
</TD><TD valign='center'>
<PRE>
array( "Tables" =>
    array( array( "Table" => 'keyframe_example_people',
                  "Fields" => array(
                      array( "col"=>"name", "type"=>"S"),
                      array( "col"=>"age",  "type"=>"I")))));

</PRE>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
The KeyFrame Relation Definition (kfrel_def) tells KeyFrame that there is one table in your relation. It specifies the table name, and
defines two columns, name and age, with their types. This gives KeyFrame all of the information that it needs to construct
SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE statements on the table.
</P>
<P>
Notice that the _key column (the primary key) is not specified in the kfrel_def. KeyFrame assumes that you always have
this column. You can use KeyFrame without a primary key called '_key', which is handy for implementing existing relations
and tables under KeyFrame, but it's highly recommended that you use this convention with new tables so that you can use
KeyFrame's join functionality.
</P>
<P>
With this kfrel_def, you can use KeyFrame to manage data in the table, and automatically generate a user interface. Plus,
KeyFrame can automatically log all changes, and keep track of who changed what.
</P>
<P>
See example1.php to see how KeyFrameRecord and KeyFrameRecordCursor classes are used to read tables, and update records.
</P>
<P>
So far, this looks like a lot of code to solve a simple problem. But there's much more. Read on to see how KeyFrame makes
more complex jobs just as easy as this basic example.
</P>







<H3>What is KeyPhrame?</H3>
<P>KeyPhrame is not another database abstraction class.  It's a set of classes for data relation abstraction,
data management, and database user interface construction.  It is designed to take the work out of database programming
while providing flexibility to the application developer.</P>

<H3>What's Relation Abstraction?</H3>
<P>Take this example.  Say you have a list of people and a list of homes.  That's a one-to-many
relationship, because each person lives in one home, and each home can have more than one person.  It can also be
called a Parent-Child relationship: the home is the parent, housing zero or more people (children).</P>
<P>In a Parent-Child relationship, the parent table has a primary key.  The rows of the child table have a foreign
key referring to the parent's primary key.  That means you get information about a child and its parent by performing
a join on the two tables where foreign key = primary key.</P>
<P>With KeyPhrame, you just define the relation.  You tell KeyPhrame that you have a Parent-Child relationship.  You
tell it the names of the tables, the names and types of the columns that you care about, and the name of the foreign key.
KeyPhrame does the rest.  It knows when and how to join the tables to get what you want.</P>
<P>Another example:  say you have a list of people and a list of college degrees.  That's a many-to-many relationship
because each person can have more than one degree, and more than one person can have the same degree.  You implement
this with two tables, each with a primary key, and a "join table" with two foreign keys that relate people and degrees.</P>
<P>With KeyPhrame, you could define three relations: a Simple (single-table) description of the people table, a Simple
description of the degrees table, and a ManyToMany relation.  The latter would tell KeyPhrame that you have a
ManyToMany relation, the names of the three tables, and the names of the two foreign keys in the join table.  KeyPhrame
would then take care of joining the tables to fetch various relations, and inserting/deleting rows from the join table
to create and remove relations between people and their degrees.</P>

<H3>Why do we need KeyPhrame?</H3>
<P>Maybe you're thinking, 'I can write SQL joins, so why do I need some class to do it for me?'  Good question.  KeyPhrame
does much more than cobble together join clauses.  It automatically timestamps all records, optionally logs updates,
and provides methods for fetching, inserting and updating records based on a single relation definition.  In other words,
if you change your data model, you only have to change your KeyPhrame definition in one place instead of rewriting all
of your SQL.</P>

<H3>Anything else?</H3>
<P>Even better, KeyPhrame provides UI tools for easy display, sorting, filtering, inputting and editing of data
records, in various data relations.  With KeyPhrame you can build a complete data management user interface for
any supported relation in under an hour, and usually with less than 50 lines of code.</P>

<H3>How does it work?</H3>
<P>KeyPhrame is called that because it is based on a framework of data relation keys.  To simplify the description of
relations, it requires primary keys and foreign keys to adhere to certain naming conventions.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The primary key of each table must be called <B>_rowid</B>, and it must be an integer.
The KeyPhrame data logic expects that.
Usually the data model designer makes it auto-increment to ensure uniqueness.
</LI>
<LI>Every foreign key must start with <B>fk_</B> followed by the name of the table.  e.g. foreign key to table <I>people</I>
must be called <B>fk_people</B></LI>
</UL>
<P>This way, KeyPhrame can create a Parent-Child join just by knowing the names of the tables.  If the parent table
is <B>homes</B> and the child table is <B>people</B>, then the join is <B>homes join people where
homes._rowid = people.fk_homes</B>.  This makes it very easy for a KeyPhrame programmer to describe the relation.</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>e.g.<PRE>
Table=people
Fields=array("firstname","lastname","birthday")
RelationType=Parent
RelationParentTable=homes
RelationParentFields= array("address","colour")
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Imagine in this example you wanted to show all information about a certain person.  Each record in the people table
has a unique _rowid, so you might query the row where people._rowid=N, where N is a known integer primary key value.
KeyPhrame would use the above description to generate the SQL
<B>SELECT people._rowid as _rowid, people.firstname as firstname, people.lastname as lastname, people.birthday as birthday,
homes._rowid as P__rowid, homes.address as P_homes, homes.colour as P_colour from people,homes
where people.fk_homes=homes._rowid and people._rowid=N</B>.


<P>
Base table fields are fetched by their column names.
Related table fields are defined with an alias.
RelationTableFields=array( array("colname"=>"address", "alias"=>"home_address", "type"=>"S") );
Then SELECT people._rowid as _rowid, people.firstname as firstname, homes.address as home_address.
The client code expects to find the values $ra['firstname'] and $ra['home_address'].
There is thus no dependency on table names in the code, so data model and table names can be changed as long as aliases
remain the same, with no need to change the code.

GrandParent Relation:
Table=kiddo
Fields=array("colname"=>"colA")
RelationType=GrandParent
RelationParentTable=dad
RelationGrandParentTable=grampa
RelationParentFields=array(array("colname"=>"colA","alias"=>"aliasA"))
RelationGrandParentFields=array(array("colname"=>"colA","alias"=>"aliasB"))

SELECT kiddo._rowid as _rowid, kiddo.colA as colA, dad.colA as aliasA, grampa.colA as aliasB FROM kiddo,dad,grampa
WHERE kiddo.fk_dad=dad._rowid AND dad.fk_grampa=grampa._rowid

Also should have a condition-generation-helper function that can retrieve the correct column name.  It shouldn't be
hard to figure it out (must use kiddo._rowid instead of just _rowid) but it would be nicer and data-model-independent
to use KPhGetDBColName("base","_rowid") to generate "kiddo._rowid" and KPhGetDBColName("parent", "aliasA") to generate
"dad.colA".
