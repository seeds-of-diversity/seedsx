install drupal8 in swww8


1)
On www12.peaceworks.ca you have to edit swww8/sites/default/files/.htaccess
Remove -MultiViews option because that causes a 500 errir on any access to "files" which is where drupal caches 
aggregated css, so you will not get any css and your themes will all look weird.


2)
In swww8/.htaccess uncomment "RewriteBase /drupal8" and change it to "RewriteBase /swww8"

If you've accessed pages using swww8 in the url you should probably clear the cache after this change.


3)
Add this to the bottom of settings.php. This helps drupal figure out what's going on when you redirect seeds.ca/A to seeds.ca/swww8/A

// Bob as per https://www.drupal.org/node/2612160
if( isset($GLOBALS['request']) && '/swww8/index.php' === $GLOBALS['request']->server->get('SCRIPT_NAME') ) {
    $GLOBALS['request']->server->set('SCRIPT_NAME', '/index.php');
}


4)
Copy bootstrap theme to swww8/themes
Copy breeze theme to swww8/themes
./cp_to_swww8
In Appearance, make seedbreeze your default theme.
