    <h3>Habitat  and Food</h3>
    <p><a href="images/PDF_Pollinator Use_Habitat and Food.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/print firendly button.png" alt="" width="50" height="37" />Printer friendly version</a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Ensuring wild pollinators have access to both nesting habitats  and additional food resources when the crop is not in bloom can go hand-in-hand  - in fact, it may be as simple as reducing disturbances to field edges or  unproductive areas on the farm.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Many of Ontario's wild solitary bees are ground-nesting species.  They require well-drained, structured soil with low-density vegetation.  South-facing slopes are usually preferred. The nests can occur in field margins  and in the cultivated area itself (where they are easily destroyed by deep  tillage). Others nest in cavities between stones, in wood, hollow twigs or  stems, and similar protected spaces. Bumble bees use larger natural cavities  for their colonies, such as abandoned rodent burrows and other sheltered  spaces. Fly pollinators nest in an even greater variety of habitats.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Wild pollinators do not forage as far as honey bees, so crops  more than about 75m from suitable nesting sites are unlikely to be visited by  these insects.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Habitat for wild pollinators should provide food resources before and  after the crop is in bloom. Pollinators need to forage on plants for the entire  season to produce the next generation of pollinators. A varied diet is good for  all pollinators, so that they can obtain the full spectrum of nutrients needed  for growth and reproduction. In the past, it was common practice to apply  herbicide to or mow non-crop plants both from the field and at its margins.  While competing flowers can be a distraction if they are more attractive to  bees than the cropâ€™s blooms, removal of competing plants is no longer  considered as necessary as it once was. For example, OMAFRA no longer  recommends frequent mowing of competing dandelions in tree fruit orchards.  Research has shown that tree fruit pollen is more attractive than dandelion  pollen. Even if some bees forage on the dandelion, it will not affect  pollination of the tree fruit to a point where control is economically  justified.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Agricultural areas that can be conserved as wild pollinator  habitat include field edges, hedgerows, and areas of low productivity (e.g.,  areas of perpetually dry or wet soils, corners difficult to access with machinery).  Research in crops such as canola and watermelon has shown that setting aside a  portion of each hectare of land as pollinator habitat can increase the net  profitability of that hectare.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>All that is required is to reduce or avoid activities such as tillage,  mowing, or spraying in these areas. Large fields can also benefit from leaving  patches as mini &quot;bee pastures&quot; that are permanently given over to  vegetation and have minimal disturbance. These patches can easily be integrated  with activities such as drainage and erosion control, or windbreak improvement. </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Growers may in fact realize an economic benefit by  &quot;retiring&quot; less productive or difficult land (e.g., former wetlands)  and using it instead to provide forage and habitat for pollinators that benefit  their crop. Again, this practice can be incorporated into other projects,  including flood control and water management, erosion control, and creating  habitat for other wildlife. Some of this alternative forage may compete for  pollinators during crop bloom, but the availability of resources outside of the  crop bloom period is good for both managed and wild pollinators. </p>
    <p><br />
      There are organizations and government programs that will assist  growers with establishing conservation projects on their farm, and may even  provide financial assistance. For example, <a href="http://www.norfolkalus.com" target="_blank">Alternative Land Use Services (ALUS)</a> is a grower-managed organization that encourages and provides funding and  information for on-farm conservation projects, including pollination  conservatio. The Canada-Ontario Environmental Farm Plan (EFP) also provides funding for on-farm pollinator conservation activities on a cost share basis. The program varies from year to year; current information is available on the <a href="http://www.ontariosoilcrop.org/en/programs/canada_ontario_environmental_farm_plan_efp.htm" target="_blank">Ontario Soil and Crop Improvement Association</a>  website. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In addition to other potential benefits, increasing the area of marginal  land dedicated to conservation will increase wild pollinator populations, and  the services they provide to crops. This, in turn, can lead to increased  profitability, as costs associated with cropping marginal land are also  reduced.</p>
