    </h3>
    <p><strong>Mating &amp;  Breeding System:</strong> Most cucumber varieties have separate male and  female flowers located on the same plant. Most varieties are  self-compatible, but due to the physical separation of the male and  female flowers, insects are required to move pollen. </p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p>There are  typically more male flowers than female flowers on a given plant, and  the male flowers mature first on an individual plant. The male flower  produces pollen, and both male and female flowers produce nectar.  Male nectar has a higher sugar concentration than the female. Bees  usually collect pollen in the morning and switch to nectar in the  afternoon, visiting both types of flowers and transferring the large,  sticky pollen grains in the process.   Fertility of the plant,  however, is greatest in the morning and declines as the day  progresses. </p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p>Flowers of both  sexes are typically open for only a single day, after which male and  insufficiently-pollinated female flowers will drop. Some male-sterile  hybrid varieties have been developed which produce only female  flowers. These varieties are intended to increase yield, but they  require interplanting of male-fertile varieties to provide pollen.  Ovaries vary in length and number of ovules, with more ovules  translating to larger fruits. Larger, older vines tend to produce  larger flowers. Maturing fertilized fruit will inhibit development of  new female flowers, and therefore limit the number of fruits an  individual vine can produce. </p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Pollination,  Quality &amp; Yield:</strong> This information applies only to field and  pickling cucumber pollination, since varieties grown in Ontario for  fresh consumption are parthenocarpic - they develop without  fertilization of the ovules. Pollination of these varieties is  undesirable because it leads to fruits with irregular and uneven  shape. Pollination may be reduced in these crops by growing them in  greenhouses, planting more attractive crops near outdoor fields,  removal of male flowers, and restricting the use of honey bees in the  vicinity during the bloom time of the cucumber. </p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p>For pickling  cucumbers, enhanced pollination can increase the number of seeds in  individual fruits, and also increase yield per hectare over  unpollinated crops or those pollinated by hand. Pollination of these  varieties also improves the shape and value of the individual fruits,  in contrast with the parthenocarpic varieties discussed above.  Cucumbers, like other cucurbits, have numerous ovules and thus  require a great deal of pollen for full pollination. As many as 18  visits by pollen carriers to female flowers are necessary for full  pollination. Flowers with larger ovaries tend to be produced by older  vines, so there is value in delaying pollination in order to produce  larger fruits with more seeds (monoecious varieties), or planting  male plants several days after female plants in gynoecious varieties  to ensure pollen availability at the correct time.</p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p><strong>Pollination  Recommendations:</strong> Honey bees are highly effective pollinators of  cucumber, providing the required number of visits and pollen  delivery. Depending on planting density, 2.5-8 hives per hectare are  recommended. Planting density in the crop varies considerably, and  these stocking recommendations are also expressed as one honey bee  colony per 50,000 plants. </p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p>The bees should be  placed in shaded areas at the edge of small fields, and can be placed  in the crop itself in larger fields in such an arrangement that any  point in the field is no more than 250m from a hive.  If hives are  placed in the field itself, shade and water should be provided for  the bees on hot days.</p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p>Bumble bees can be  more effective pollinators than honey bees due to their earlier  foraging hours and higher floral visitation rate.  They may be of  greatest practical utility on pickling cucumbers in greenhouses due  to the large number of expensive colonies that would be required in a  field situation. If a male-sterile variety is used, care must be  taken to plant a <a href="glossary.html">pollenizer</a> variety in the field, at a rate of 5-15%  of total seed.  In this scenario, honey bees (which naturally prefer  staminate flowers, even though their prime target is nectar) are  forced to visit the female flowers more frequently. Brood pheromone  has been shown to improve pollen foraging by honey bees on cucurbits  in the southern U.S. and its potential for use in Ontario should be  further investigated.<br />
        <br />
    </p>
    <p>Small and large  ground-nesting bees are effective cucumber pollinators, but are  rarely present at the densities needed to perform this service at an  agricultural scale. In small fields of cucurbits, or in large fields  managed with them in mind, the native squash bee <em>Peponapis  pruinosa</em> does an admirable job of cucurbit pollination. This  ground-nesting bee works in the early morning, when the flowers are  at their highest fertility, and can reach very high densities at the  field margins and within the field itself. Other wild bees,  particularly bumble bees, are also effective cucurbit pollinators.</p>
