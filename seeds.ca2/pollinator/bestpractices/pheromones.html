    <h3>Chemical Manipulation of Pollinator Behaviour</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p><a href="images/PDF_Pollinator Use_Chemical Manipulation.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/print firendly button.png" alt="" width="50" height="37" />Printer friendly version</a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are chemicals available on the market that mimic the  pheromones honey bees use to communicate. Some can be sprayed on a crop to  attract bees - in theory these improve pollination by drawing bees into the  crop and reducing competition from more attractive blooms elsewhere. This can  be particularly useful in crops that are not particularly attractive to honey  bees. Others manipulate behaviour inside the hive, and encourage foraging  activity in general. These products have had mixed results in the field, and  additional research may lead to more effective use specific crops. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Queen Mandibular Pheromone (QMP)</strong> is a group of (at  least) five active compounds produced by queen honey bees. The pheromone aids  in queen control of the colony and colony cohesion. Products containing  synthetic QMP, such as FruitBoost™, are used to increase foraging activity of  worker bees when sprayed on a crop. Elevated levels of QMP are also correlated  with increased pollen foraging activity, which can translate to higher rates of  flower visitation.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
     <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Some believe that synthetic  QMP lacks one or more components present natural QMP, and thus may not be as  effective as claimed. Again, mixed results have been found in the field. An  application of FruitBoost™ was unable to improve pollination in watermelon when  more attractive sunflower was blooming nearby. In tree fruits, there was no  effect of QMP on yield or fruit quality in apple or sweet cherry orchards, but  a a significant economic return could be achieved in pear, which is normally  unattractive to pollinators due to low-quality nectar. It was also possible to  increase yields in cranberry and blueberry, although it was also possible to  concentrate the QMP too strongly, which deterred visiting honey bees.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Brood pheromone</strong> is produced by salivary glands in honey bee larvae. It tells worker  bees that larvae are present and require pollen. A commercial formulation  (SuperBoost™) placed inside a colony will simulate the presence of more brood,  which encourages foragers to collect more pollen and visit more flowers.  Experiments in cucurbit fields showed that the product led to a higher  proportion of pollen foragers and larger pollen loads carried from the target  crop. It may also have benefits for the colony, including the production of  more brood and honey, increased potential for colony splitting, and improved  overwintering success. From a pollination standpoint, the use of brood  pheromone in this manner results in more pollen and nectar foragers, higher  flower visitation rates, greater pollen loads and more pollen brought back to  the hive, and more adult bees. </p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>BeeScent™ is a commercial blend of pheromones that is believed  to attract bees when sprayed onto a blooming crop. It includes a synthetic  Nasonov pheromone, which is a cocktail of compounds secreted by bees that  attracts bees and leads to cohesion among nestmates. It will cause bees to  congregate in an area, and may be used by beekeepers to attract and capture  swarms. It is also used by bees in the field to recruit other foragers to high  quality sources of food and water. One study found increases of 50-100% in bee  activity in sprayed crops; however, it is not certain if BeeScent™ is more  attractive that other odours detectable by the bees, such as cinnamon oil, or  improves productivity or profitability in the crops to which it is applied. </p>
    <p><br />
      BeeLine™ differs from the other products discussed here in that  it is not a pheromone, but rather a wettable powder food supplement. It  contains sugars, fats, proteins, and other nutrients, and is intended to  attract bees and other pollinators to the crop and stimulate their desire to  feed. Some trials have had disappointing results in both the ability of  BeeLineTM to attract bees, and to improve seed sets or yields. However, even if  pollination is not improved, it is likely to improve the health of the visiting  insects.</p>
