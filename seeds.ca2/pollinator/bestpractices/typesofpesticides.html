    <h3><strong>Types of Pesticides</strong></h3>
    <p><a href="images/PDF_Pesticides - Types of Pesticides.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/print firendly button.png" alt="" width="50" height="37" />Printer friendly version</a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are several different classes of  pesticides (see below) and they have a wide range of toxicity to honey bees  (honey bees are typically the only pollinator used to test the toxicity of  pesticides).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>  
    <p>OMAFRA has compiled a list of pesticides by trade name and grouped  according to whether they are highly toxic, moderately toxic or relatively  non-toxic.Â  Click on <a href="http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/food/inspection/bees/pollination.htm#table1" target="_blank">thumbnail</a> below to access the  list.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Chemical Classes</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Organophosphates:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>There are many common active ingredients  classified as organophosphates (many ending in -phos, -fos, -vos, or -thion).  These compounds have a wide range of toxicity levels and are chemically similar  to nerve gases developed for human warfare. Organophosphate insecticides  inhibit the activity of an enzyme in the nervous system (acetylcholinesterase),  leading to overstimulation and dysfunction of the nervous system. Symptoms of  organophosphate poisoning in honey bees include loss of activity, abnormal  wobbly movements, lying on the back or spinning while beating wings in this  position, and/or regurgitation of collected nectar. Damage to brood and queen  by exposure to microencapsulated methyl parathion or acephate (acetamidophos)  have also been recorded</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Neonicotinoids:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Neonicotinoid insecticides target the nervous  system of insects, blocking an acetylcholine receptor. They are a class of  synthetic compounds based on the naturally occuring compound nicotine, itself  used as an agricultural insecticide. They have become one of the most commonly  used insecticide classes in recent years, with compounds registered on many  major crops for foliar application and/or seed treatment. Active ingredients  include imidicloprid, clothiandin, thiamethoxam, acetamiprid, thiacloprid, and  dinotefuran. They are are sold under a variety of trade names, and all are  classified as highly toxic or toxic to honey bees. They are systemic  insecticides, meaning that the compounds are present in the plant tissues  rather than just on the surface. There is evidence that pollinators may be  exposed via the resources they collect, but further research is required to  determine the details and how problems might be mitigated.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Neonicotinoid compounds may also pose a hazard  if used as a seed treatment or sprayed before bloom, as they can be present in  dust from seed drills, pollen, nectar, and guttation water. Neonicotinoids are  the group of pesticides most commonly implicated as a contributing cause of  widespread honey bee losses, both through  direct toxic action and chronic effects on the immune system. Research is  ongoing into the role of these compounds in honey bee declines, but it is  recommended that their use near bees or blooming crops or wildflowers be avoided. The Xerces Society recently published a <strong><a href="http://www.xerces.org/neonicotinoids-and-bees/" target="_blank">review</a></strong> of the scientific literature on the effects of neonicotinoids on bees.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Pyrethroids:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Pyrethroid insecticides are a class of  synthetic compounds based on the naturally occuring compound pyrethrin, which  is extracted from chrysanthemum flowers. Pyrethrin is noted for its quick  'knock-down' of insects, but the natural compound is not always lethal, and  degrades readily in the environment. Synthetic pyrethroids have been chemically  stabilized to increase their persistence in field applications and/or increase  toxicity. Pyrethroids are sometimes mixed with other insecticides, either in a  brand-name product or tank-mixed at the application site. Symptoms of  pyrethroid poisoning in honey bees include regurgitation of collected nectar.</p>
    <p><br />
        <strong>N-Methyl Carbamates:</strong>&nbsp;N-methyl carbamates, or simply carbamates, are commonly  used insecticides. The names of many of these active ingredients end in the  suffix -carb, and the class also includes several insecticides that are  responsible for many bee poisonings (carbaryl, carbofuran). Like the  organophosphates, they are inhibitors of acetylcholine metabolism in the  nervous system, and thus share similar symptoms. Symptoms of carbamate  poisoning in honey bees include an inability to fly in adult bees, dead brood  or newly emerged workers, or queen loss. Sublethal effects on the queen have  also been recorded, such as poor or erratic egg laying performance.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Organochlorines:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Many organochlorine compounds, the most famous  of which is DDT, are no longer used in North America. However, insecticides  containing the active ingredient endosulfan are still used and sold under the  trade name Thionex or Thiodan in Ontario. Symptoms of organochlorine poisoning  in honey bees include loss of activity, abnormal wobbly movements, lying on the  back or spinning while beating wings in this position.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Insect Growth Regulators:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>These compounds are analogues of hormones or  other compounds that regulate the development of immature insects. Novaluron  (the most common active ingredient in this group) has been found to have very  low toxicity to adults of several bee species, including honey bees, in  laboratory toxicological studies. However, it has been linked to impaired brood  development in honey bees in the field.</p>
