    <h3>What is Pollination?</h3>
    <a href="images/PDF_What Is Pollination.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/print firendly button.png" alt="" width="50" height="37" />Printer friendly version</a><br />
    <br />
    <p>Pollination is the first  step in the process of sexual reproduction in plants. In pollination, a male  pollen grain is transferred to the female part of a flower, germinates and  fertilizes the ovule. All of these steps must occur for a seed to develop.  Without pollination, the production of many of the seeds and fruits that we eat  would not be possible.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/What is Pollination.jpg" width="650" height="154" /></p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>As in all sexually  reproducing organisms, mating in plants results in offspring that contain genes  from both parents. Unlike animals, plants cannot seek each other out. They must  rely on wind, water, or animals to move pollen between plants. Wind is  responsible for pollinating many staple crops such as wheat and corn, but many  Ontario crops rely heavily or completely on insects for pollination. Bees are  the most commonly discussed pollinators, but many other insects and even  vertebrates can play a role (see <a href="http://www.pollinator.ca/canpolin/animal_pollinators.html">Pollinators</a>).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Insects that visit  flowers are in search of <a href="http://www.pollinator.ca/canpolin/glossary.html" target="_blank"><strong>pollen</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.pollinator.ca/canpolin/glossary.html" target="_blank"><strong>nectar</strong></a>. Most flowers produce  nectar just to attract pollinators. The higher the concentration of sugar in  the nectar, the more attractive it is to pollinators. Nectar can also contain  other useful compounds such as lipids, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals.  Pollen is high in protein, carbohydrate, lipids, and vitamins. It is valuable  to some adult insects as a food source, and especially to bees looking for food  for their young (larvae). A <a href="http://www.pollinator.ca/canpolin/glossary.html" target="_blank"><strong>nectary</strong></a> (nectar-producing  organ)is usually positioned within the flower so that  visitors to the flower have to contact the reproductive organs to access the  nectar.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Plants that can self-fertilize (or self-compatible) can still benefit  from cross-pollination because it can lead to more or higher quality fruit. In  these plants, self-pollination is often an emergency mechanism in case  cross-pollination does not occur. Because plants prefer to invest their  resources in cross-pollinated offspring, self-pollination often produces fewer  fruit ,or fruit that is smaller or misshapen.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;    </p>
    <h3>Flower Anatomy &amp; Function<br />
      <br />
                    </h3>
    <p>There is an incredible variety of  floral shapes in nature, but they are all derived from the same basic  structure.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/plant sexual reproduction.jpg" width="448" height="419" /></p>
    <p align="center"><font size="-2"> copyright Cara Dawson</font></p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p>All plant  reproduction requires that pollen be transmitted to the female organ, or <a href="glossary.html">pistil</a>. (The exception is <em>agamospermy</em>, in which a plant produces viable seed without being  fertilized.) </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Pollen is produced  by the male organ, called the <a href="glossary.html">stamen</a>.  The stamen  consists of an <a href="glossary.html">anther</a> atop a long <a href="glossary.html">filament</a>.  Pollen grains  released by the anther  are picked up by visiting insects or the wind.    When a pollen grain reaches the female pistil (which may be on  the same or a different flower), it germinates on the <a href="glossary.html">stigma</a>, forming a pollen tube that grows  through the <a href="glossary.html">style</a>  and into the <a href="glossary.html">ovary</a>.  The fertilized <a href="glossary.html">ovules</a> then develop into seeds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Flowers may have  male <u>or</u> female organs (called <em>imperfect flowers</em>), or both (referred  to as <em>perfect flowers)</em>. Examples of crops with perfect flowers include  apples, cherries and legumes; crops with imperfect flowers include squash,  cucumber and corn. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>These terms should  not be confused with those that describe the plant as whole. A species may have  individual plants that produce either male or female flowers (<em>dioecious</em>,  from the Greek for 'two houses'), or plants that produce both (e.g.,  hermaphrodite or <em>monoecious</em>, 'one house'). In those species that are  monoecious, individual plants may have their male and female functions in  separate (imperfect) flowers, in perfect flowers, or they may have two or even  all three of the flower types. Monoecious plants may also have sexual functions  separated in time. This means that the pollen production and stigma receptivity  to the pollen occur at different times. All of the crops covered in this  website are monoecious, but may have perfect or imperfect flowers.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Inbreeding  (self-fertilization or fertilization by close relatives) can reduce the vigour  and health of living things. An inbred plant may perform poorly and leave fewer  offspring. In a crop plant, this may mean lower yields. While plants do not  suffer as rapidly or severely from inbreeding as animals do, most have ways to reduce  or eliminate the possibility of self-fertilization. Self-fertilization is  usually only a back-up mechanism in case cross-pollination does not occur. The  most effective way to ensure cross-fertilization is for plants to be dioecious,  but these plants have no alternative in the event that cross pollination does  not occur. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are many different ways that plants avoid self-fertilization.  These include physical separation of male and female flower parts on the plant,  or staggering the fertility of male and female flowers over time. Some plants  may prevent self-fertilization by chemically preventing germination of their  own pollen on the stigma.</p>
