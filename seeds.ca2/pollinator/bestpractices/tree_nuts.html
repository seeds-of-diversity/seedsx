    <h3>Tree Nuts</h3>
    <p><img src="images/tree_nuts.jpg" width="424" height="283" /></p>
    <p>
    <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
    </p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p>Nuts are usually grown  under warmer conditions than are found in Ontario, but there are several types  of nuts native to the province that are of interest for local consumption or  commercial development (beaked hazelnut, black walnut). There are some  non-native commercial species that have been imported. Many nuts require long  hot growing seasons, and because they are growing near the northern limit of  hardiness, they can be a risky crop. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Most are  wind-pollinated and self-fruitful, although there are exceptions, and wild  populations of at least some species appear to have mechanisms in place to  encourage cross-fertilization, and produce higher quality nuts when  cross-pollinated.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>American Chestnut (<em>Castanea dentata</em>) </h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="images/PDF_American chestnut.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/print firendly button.png" alt="" width="50" height="37" />Printer friendly version</a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The chestnut was once  an important tree in eastern deciduous forests, with the northern edge of its  distribution in southern Ontario. After the chestnut blight was introduced in  1904, the species declined precipitously in the wild, and few trees remain in  Ontario forests. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Chestnut is  self-compatible, but still requires cross-pollination because the male and  female flowers do not bloom at the same time on an individual tree. The flowers  are in the form of catkins, and a variety of pollinators collect both nectar  and pollen from the flowers. Unlike most other nut trees, the American chestnut  is pollinated by insects. Wild trees generally cannot reproduce due to the isolation  of individual trees, and artificial propagation is necessary to propagate the  species.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the related  Caucasian chestnut tree, <em>Castanea sativa, </em>pollination by honey bees  can improve total nut yield. A stocking rate of 1.5 colonies per hectare has  been recommended. Because chestnuts are functionally self-sterile (due to the  asynchrony of male and female flowers), pollenizers of a different variety should be  available at a rate of one-tenth to one-half of the production trees. The  pollenizers and production cultivars can be planted in different rows to  simplify the harvest.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Almond (<em>Prunus dulcis</em>) </h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="images/PDF_Almond.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/print firendly button.png" alt="" width="50" height="37" />Printer friendly version</a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Although almond is not  commercially cultivated to any great extent in Ontario, it is one of the most  valuable crops and one of the largest users of managed honey bees in the world,  most notably in California. It is a member of the same genus as stone fruits  (cherry, plum, peach, apricot, nectarine), but differs in that the stone (nut)  is the primary crop. Almond growing in Ontario is generally restricted to  hobbyists and landscaping use, as the climate is too harsh and unpredictable  for commercial production.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The flowers are  self-incompatible, and require cross-pollination by insects with an appropriate  pollenizer cultivar. There is a trend towards the development and use of  self-compatible variety, although the effect of self-pollen on yield, size, and  flavour requires further investigation. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For regular  self-incompatible almonds, research has shown that the pollenizer trees must  not be more than a few meters away for optimal fruit set, as honey bees tend to  visit a single tree or cultivar during a foraging trip. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>However, it has also  been found that most (90%) of honey bees in an almond orchard carry  cross-pollen on their bodies.Â  In the  case of honey bees, much of this pollen acquisition may result from transfer  between foragers within the hive.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In Ontario, early  pollination is essential if the tree is to have a chance to produce mature  fruit. Each flower contains only one pair of ovules, so unlike pome fruits,  asymmetry of poorly pollinated fruit is less of a problem. However, poorly  pollinated blossoms may drop. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The presence of toxic  compounds such as amygdalin in almond nectar and pollen can have ill effects on  pollinators if consumed in large doses. This is a particular problem for honey  bees pollinating large almond monocultures in the US.<br />
        <br />
      Both bumble bees and blue orchard bees have demonstrated potential for  pollinating almond, although further research into their effectiveness for this  particular crop is necessary. Wild bees and possibly flies are may also be  valuable.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Walnut, Butternut, Heartnut (<em>Juglans</em> spp.) </h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="images/PDF_Walnut et al.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/print firendly button.png" alt="" width="50" height="37" />Printer friendly version</a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Cultivated members of  this group in Ontario includes the native black walnut (<em>Juglans nigra</em>)  and butternut (<em>J. cinerea</em>), and the exotic Japanese walnut, also known  as the heartnut (<em>J. ailantifolia</em>). The cultivated walnut familiar to  most consumers is the Carpathian walnut (<em>J. regia</em>), which is  comparable to apple in hardiness for Ontario. There is also a hybrid of the  butternut and the heartnut, which is known as the buartnut. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Members of genus <em>Juglans</em> are monoecious and wind-pollinated, with the male and female reproductive  structures in separate flowers on each tree. Male flowers are found on long,  pendulous catkins, while female flowers are small and inconspicuous, borne near  the tips of the growing branches. Individual trees, while self-compatible,  typically release pollen before or after the female flowers are receptive  (depending on cultivar), which limits self-fertilization. Thus, other trees of  an appropriate cultivar are necessary to ensure that pollen is available during  female receptivity. </p>
    <p><br />
      Pollination by a  suitable cultivar is generally required to set a nut crop. Even species and  cultivars that are self-fruitful, such as the heartnut, will produce a larger  crop if cross-pollinated.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3>Hickory nut (<em>Carya</em> spp.) </h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="images/PDF_Hickory nut.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/print firendly button.png" alt="" width="50" height="37" />Printer friendly version</a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This genus is also a  member of the walnut family, and has similar reproductive biology. It includes  a number of valuable nut crops such as pecan, shagbark hickory (<em>Carya ovata</em>),  shellbark hickory (<em>C. laciniosa</em>), and northern pecan (<em>C.  illinoinensis</em>). Also available are &quot;hican&quot; trees, which are a  hybrid between shellbark hickory and pecan. Pecans in particular are poorly  suited to the Ontario climate, although there are some naturally occurring  genetic lines that have been found growing as far north as southern Wisconsin.  These trees were likely planted by native Americans, and those that have  managed to survive and produce fruit resulted in small, localized populations.  All trees in this genus are self-fruitful, but the quality of the product seems  to benefit from the planting of mixed cultivars, as much as is possible  considering the climate restrictions. The trees can be expected to abort a high  proportion of pistillate flowers whether or not they have been pollinated in  response to resource availability rather than pollination deficiencies.</p>
    <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
    <h3>Hazelnut / Filbert (<em>Corylus</em> spp.) </h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><a href="images/PDF_Almond.pdf" target="_blank"><img src="images/print firendly button.png" alt="" width="50" height="37" />Printer friendly version</a></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>There are several  cultivated species of hazelnut, also known as filbert, and most are European in  origin. The most commonly cultivated species is <em>Corylus avellana</em>, the  European hazel. However, there are several species native to the New World that  produce edible nuts, including American filbert (<em>C. americana</em>) and  beaked hazelnut (<em>C. cornuta</em>). Hazelnuts bear flowers in the form of  catkins, with male catkins and less conspicuous female flowers occurring  separately. Both sexes are found on the same tree (<em>monoecy</em>) in most  cases, although a few single-sex plants may occur. Beaked hazelnut, at least,  is self-incompatible.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For all species,  growers typically plant two varieties together to facilitate pollination and  nut set. European hazelnuts are wind-pollinated, but cross-pollination is  preferred despite some level of self-compatibility in this species. Although it  produces smaller nuts, the native species are the preferred choice in most  parts of Ontario, as the cultivated European hazel is not as hardy. </p>
