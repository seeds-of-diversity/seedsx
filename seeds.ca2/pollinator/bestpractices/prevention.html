    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p>Pesticides can have both  lethal and sublethal impacts on managed and wild pollinators. Pollinators can  be exposed to pesticides by walking or flying in sprayed areas, or consuming  contaminated food or water. In honey bee hives, foragers returning to the hive  with contaminated food and water can expose the queen, the brood and younger  workers. Pesticides can become “concentrated” in the hive’s wax, stored pollen  and nectar, and in the bodies of adults and brood.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="images/bees in hive shutterstock_5466952.jpg" width="350" height="233" /><img src="images/wax comb shutterstock_49538386.jpg" width="350" height="233" /></p>
    <p><br />
    </p>
    <p>Because they are specifically  designed to kill insects, insecticide exposure is the primary concern. However,  fungicides and herbicides can also have a harmful impact on pollinators.  It is hard to predict the full impact of pesticide  exposure on bees in the field, because other factors (e.g., environmental  conditions, disease, poor nutrition) can play a role. There can also be serious  sublethal or chronic effects. These may include effects on spatial skills and  learning, which in turn can impact pollination activities.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Many transgenic crops require fewer  pesticide applications, which can benefit pollinators. Current research has  found that these crops are&nbsp;<em>relatively</em>&nbsp;safe for managed bees  (although further studies of the long-term health of bee colonies that collect  and store pollen from genetically modified crops are still necessary).</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>With conventional pesticides, exposure can result from drifting,  accidents or equipment malfunction, human error, illegal or misuse of  pesticides, and so forth. A new study has found that insecticidal seed  treatments can lead to new routes of pesticide exposure for pollinators, when  contaminated dust is blown from planting equipment into the surrounding  landscape. This dust may lead to residues in the nectar, pollen and <a href="glossary.html">guttation</a> droplets  of non-target plants – all of which may lead to lethal or sublethal effects on  bees.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Protecting Pollinators from Pesticides</strong></p>
    <p>The most important tool in protecting  pollinators from pesticide exposure is&nbsp;<strong>communication</strong>&nbsp;between  growers, beekeepers, neighbours, and agriculture professionals. This will allow  appropriate measures to be taken to protect or move the bees. Before applying a  pesticide, advise beekeepers with hives within 1 km of your crop so they can  move colonies as needed.  For a list of  beekeepers in the area, contact the Provincial Apiarist at 1-888-466-2372 ext.  63595 (<a href="mailto:paul.kozak@ontario.ca">paul.kozak@ontario.ca</a>). </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Pollination contractors are acutely  aware of the risks that pesticides pose to their bees. They may refuse to place  their bees near a field that could be sprayed while their bees are foraging in  it, or where spray may drift onto the hives, onto blooming plants in the field  margins, or onto the crops which they were hired to pollinate. For example,  some beekeepers will not rent bees for use on fields close to sweet corn if the  corn will be in bloom during the contracted period.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>If spraying must occur near honey  bees, the best option is to remove the hives from the area entirely. Failing  that, covering the hives with damp burlap will provide some protection. Bees  that are covered must be left some room and provided with an accessible source  of fresh water under the cover to allow them to cool the hive during the  confinement. Feeding the bees with sugar syrup may help keep the nectar  foragers inside the hive during the period of risk.  </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Solitary bee domiciles (alfalfa  leafcutter bees, orchard bees) may be moved out of the area at night when the  females are resting in the tubes. They should be stored at a cool temperature  until the hazard has passed and they can be returned to the field.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Growers and pesticide applicators  should be aware of how difficult, time-consuming and disruptive to the bees  wrapping or moving hives can be.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Any pesticide applications should  take place when there is minimal risk of foraging bees being exposed (e.g., at  night when foragers are not active). Spraying after 7 p.m. is the safest  option, as this allows the spray to dry before the bees are exposed to it the  next day. The next safest window is early in the morning, before it warms up  enough for foragers to become active.   Spraying should be completed no later than 7 a.m.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Spray equipment should always be kept  in proper working order, and the appropriate nozzle for the job chosen  according to the label direction. Dusts and wettable powder formulations are  often more toxic than liquids or granulated forms. Drift control is critical;  do not spray when winds exceed 5-10 km/hr, or if the wind is blowing towards  the direction of beehives or pollinator habitat.  Ground application should be used instead of aerial application  whenever possible. Serious honey bee kills can result when insecticides are  applied to a crop containing flowering weeds, even if the crop itself is not in  bloom. Bees can collect contaminated pollen and nectar from a field and carry  it back to the hive, potentially harming the queen and brood. Quality scouting  and economic threshold decision tools should be used to minimize pesticide use  wherever possible.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In greenhouse crops, foliar  application of insecticide can harm managed bumble bee pollinators, but at  least in one case (using thiamethoxam) applying the pesticide via the  irrigation system eliminated negative effects on the pollinators. This method  has not been tested on high-value outdoor crops receiving drip irrigation, but  may hold some promise.</p>
    <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Summary of Pollinator Pesticide Safety Tips:<br />
    </strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Only spray if  necessary. A crop that is in bloom should never be treated with a pesticide.</li>
      <li>Time insecticide  applications appropriately. (After 7 p.m., or before 7 a.m.) </li>
      <li>Do not spray when  it is windy (&gt;5-10 km/hr) or if the wind is blowing towards the direction of  beehives or pollinator habitat.</li>
      <li>Clip or beat down  weeds or cover crops that are blooming in the target field prior to spraying.</li>
      <li>Choose an  insecticide and formulation that is not highly toxic to bee (for more  information, see Types of  Pesticides) </li>
    </ul>
