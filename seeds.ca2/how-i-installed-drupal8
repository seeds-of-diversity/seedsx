To Create:

# get drupal using composer
cd ~/public_html
mkdir sw8
~/composer/composer.phar create-project drupal-composer/drupal-project:8.x-dev sw8 --stability dev --no-interaction

# get breeze and bootstrap - breeze has bootstrap as a dependency so just let it get the version that it wants
cd ~/public_html/sw8
~/composer/composer.phar require drupal/breeze:^1.11

# copy our themes and modules 
cd ~/public_html/sw8
mkdir web/sites/all
cp -R ../drupalmod/d8/copy_to_drupal/modules web/sites/all
cp -R ../drupalmod/d8/copy_to_drupal/themes web/sites/all

# install via http://.../sw8/web
# databases: sw8 in seeds3.drupal8_*
#            sw8test in seeds3.drupal8test_*

# Go to Extend and install module "seeds"
# Go to Admin->Appearance and install SeedBreeze as the theme
# If/When that breaks the site, it's because seedbreeze.theme can't find SITEROOT/drupalmod. Put a var_dump in there and fix the path to site.php
# Also I found from drupal.org forums and it worked for me twice: css/js aggregation fails on seeds.ca if web/default/files/.htaccess tries to change -MultiViews
#     So remove that from Options at the top, and suddenly all your css and js works. Also you can see apache saying in error.log that MultiViews can't be changed.

# Error reporting in sw8test - this is added at the top of settings.php to see what goes wrong
error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', TRUE);
ini_set('display_startup_errors', TRUE);
$config['system.logging']['error_level'] = 'verbose';


#multilingual
# In Extend add 4 core modules in the Multilingual section
# In Configuration->Regional->Languages add French as a language
# In Languages there is a tab called Detection - choose URL->"Domain" seeds.ca and semences.ca
# In Conf->Regional->Content-language there are Custom Language Settings - check Content, Custom block, Custom menu link - check the basic page, etc, probably uncheck Promoted to front page and Sticky at top of lists (for Basic page)
# In Blocks there is a Language Switcher block that you can place somewhere


# Multi-level menus: only the top level of a menu will be shown by default. The non-intuitive way to enable submenus is Structure->Block layout->find the menu->Configure->increase menu levels (default 1)

# to Update:
cd ~/public_html/sw8
~/composer/composer.phar update
